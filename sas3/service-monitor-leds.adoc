You can monitor the health of your disk shelf by understanding the location and status conditions of the LEDs on your disk shelf components.

== Operator display panel LEDs

The LEDs on the disk shelf front operator display panel indicate whether your disk shelf is functioning normally or there are problems with the hardware.

The following table describes the three LEDs on the operator display panel used in DS460C, DS224C, and DS212C disk shelves:

Attention
a|
Solid amber
a|
An error occurred with the function of one of more FRUs: the disk shelf, disk drives, IOM12/IOM12B modules, or power supplies.

Check event messages to determine corrective action to take.
a|
Blinking amber
a|
The shelf ID is in a pending state.

Power cycle the disk shelf for the shelf ID to take affect.

Location
a|
Solid blue

The system administrator activated this LED function to aid in physically locating the disk shelf requiring service.

The location LED on the operator display panel and both IOM12/IOM12B modules illuminate when this LED function is activated. Location LEDs automatically turn off after 30 minutes.
|===
Depending on your disk shelf model, the operator display panel looks different; however, the three LEDs are arranged in the same way.

The following illustration is of a DS224C disk shelf operator display panel with the end cap on:

== IOM12/IOM12B module LEDs

The LEDs on the IOM12/IOM12B module indicate whether the module is functioning normally, whether it is ready for I/O traffic, and whether there are any problems with the hardware.

The following table describes IOM12/IOM12B module LEDs associated with the function of the module and the function of each SAS port on the module.

The IOM12/IOM12B module is used in DS460C, DS224C, and DS212C disk shelves.

IOM12/IOM12B module function: An error occurred with the function of the IOM12/IOM12B module.

SAS port function: Less than all four SAS lanes established a link (with either an adapter or another disk shelf).

Check event messages to determine corrective action to take.

Location
a|
Solid blue

The system administrator activated this LED function to aid in physically locating the disk shelf with the failed IOM12/IOM12B module.

The location LED on the operator display panel and both IOM12/IOM12B modules illuminate when this LED function is activated. Location LEDs automatically turn off after 30 minutes.

|===
The following illustration is for an IOM12 module:

== Power supply LEDs

The LEDs on the power supply indicate whether the power supply is functioning normally or there are hardware problems.

The following table describes the two LEDs on power supplies used in DS460C, DS224C, and DS212C disk shelves:

[cols="4*",options="header"]
|===
| LED icon| LED name| State| Description
.2+|
image:../media/drw_sas_power_icon.svg[width=20px]
.2+|
Power
a|
Solid green
a|
The power supply is functioning correctly.
a|
Off
a|
The power supply failed, the AC switch is turned off, the AC power cord is not properly installed, or electricity is not being properly supplied to the power supply.

Check event messages to determine corrective action to take.

a|
image::../media/drw_sas_fault_icon.svg[width=5px]
a|
Attention
a|
Solid amber
a|
An error occurred with the function of the power supply.

Check event messages to determine corrective action to take.

|===
Depending on your disk shelf model, power supplies can be different, dictating the location of the two LEDs.

The following illustration is for a power supply used in a DS460C disk shelf.

The two LED icons act as the labels and LEDs, meaning the icons themselves illuminate--there are no adjacent LEDs.

== Fan LEDs on DS460C disk shelves

The LEDs on the DS460C fans indicate whether the fan is functioning normally or there are hardware problems.

The following table describes the LEDs on fans used in DS460C disk shelves:

== Disk drive LEDs

The LEDs on a disk drive indicates whether it is functioning normally or there are problems with the hardware.

=== Disk drive LEDs for DS224C and DS212C disk shelves

The following table describes the two LEDs on the disk drives used in DS224C and DS212C disk shelves:

[cols="4*",options="header"]

Attention
a|
Solid amber
a|
An error occurred with the function of the disk drive.

Check event messages to determine corrective action to take.

|===
Depending on your disk shelf model, disk drives are arranged vertically or horizontally in the disk shelf, dictating the location of the two LEDs.

The following illustration is for a disk drive used in a DS224C disk shelf.

DS224C disk shelves use 2.5-inch disk drives arranged vertically in the disk shelf.

image::../media/drw_diskdrive_ds224c.gif[]

The following illustration is for a disk drive used in a DS212C disk shelf.

DS212C disk shelves use 3.5-inch disk drives or 2.5-inch disk drives in carriers arranged horizontally in the disk shelf.
