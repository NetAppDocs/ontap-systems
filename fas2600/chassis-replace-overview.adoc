[.lead]
To replace the chassis, you must move the power supplies, hard drives, and controller module or modules from the impaired chassis to the new chassis, and swap out the impaired chassis from the equipment rack or system cabinet with the new chassis of the same model as the impaired chassis.

All other components in the system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

* You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your system.
* This procedure is written with the assumption that you are moving all drives and controller module or modules to the new chassis, and that the chassis is a new component from NetApp.
* This procedure is disruptive. For a two-node cluster, you will have a complete service outage and a partial outage in a multi-node cluster.
