To replace the boot media, you must remove the impaired controller module, install the replacement boot media, and transfer the boot image to a USB flash drive.

If your storage system is running ONTAP 9.17.1 or later, use the automated boot recovery procedure. If your system is running an earlier version of ONTAP, you must use the manual boot recovery process.
