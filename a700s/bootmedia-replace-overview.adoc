The primary boot media stores the ONTAP boot image that the system uses when it boots. You can restore the primary boot media image by using the ONTAP image on the secondary boot media, or if necessary, by using a USB flash drive.

If your secondary boot media has failed or is missing the image.tgz file, you must restore the primary boot media using a USB flash drive. The drive must be formatted to FAT32 and must have the appropriate amount of storage to hold the image_xxx.tgz file.

* The replacement process restores the var file system from the secondary boot media or USB flash drive to the primary boot media.
* You must replace the failed component with a replacement FRU component you received from your provider.
* It is important that you apply the commands in these steps on the correct controller:
 ** The _impaired_ controller is the controller on which you are performing maintenance.
 ** The _healthy_ controller is the HA partner of the impaired controller.

If you need to replace the secondary boot media while the primary boot media is installed and healthy, contact NetApp Support and mention the https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/OHW/OHW-KBs/How_to_replace_the_secondary_boot_device_of_an_a700s[How to replace the secondary boot device of an AFF A700s^] KB article.
