This guide gives detailed step-by-step instructions for installing a typical NetApp system. Use this guide if you want more detailed installation instructions.

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

To install your system, you need to create an account on the NetApp Support Site, register your system, and get license keys. You also need to inventory the appropriate number and type of cables for your system and collect specific network information.

.Before you begin

You need to have access to the Hardware Universe for information about site requirements as well as additional information on your configured system. You might also want to have access to the Release Notes for your version of ONTAP for more information about this system.

https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe]

http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[Find the Release Notes for your version of ONTAP 9]

You need to provide the following at your site:

* Rack space for the storage system
* Phillips #2 screwdriver
* Additional networking cables to connect your system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser

.Steps
. Unpack the contents of all boxes.
. Record the system serial number from the controllers.
+

. Inventory and make a note of the number and types of cables you received.
+
The following table identifies the types of cables you might receive. If you receive a cable not listed in the table, see the Hardware Universe to locate the cable and identify its use.

Powering up the system
|===

. Review the _NetApp ONTAP Confiuration Guide_ and collect the required information listed in that guide.
+
https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2862613[ONTAP Configuration Guide]

== Step 2: Install the hardware

You need to install your system in a 4-post rack or NetApp system cabinet, as applicable.

.Steps
. Install the rail kits, as needed.
. Install and secure your system using the instructions included with the rail kit.
+
NOTE: You need to be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the system.
+
image::../media/drw_9000_lifting_icon.png[]

NOTE: The label on the left indicates an empty chassis, while the label on the right indicates a fully-populated system.

. Attach cable management devices (as shown).
+
image::../media/drw_9000_cable_management_arms.png[]

. Place the bezel on the front of the system.

== Step 3: Cable controllers to your network

You can cable the controllers to your network by using the two-node switchless cluster method or by using the cluster interconnect network.

=== Option 1: Two-node switchless cluster

Management network, data network, and management ports on the controllers are connected to switches. The cluster interconnect ports are cabled on both controllers.

You must have contacted your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

Be sure to check the direction of the cable pull-tabs when inserting the cables in the ports. Cable pull-tabs are up for all networking module ports.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_up.png[]

NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

.Steps
. Use the animation or illustration to complete the cabling between the controllers and to the switches:

image::../media/drw_9000_TNSC_composite_cabling.png[]

. Go to <<Step 4: Cable controllers to drive shelves>> for drive shelf cabling instructions.

=== Option 2: Switched cluster

Management network, data network, and management ports on the controllers are connected to switches. The cluster interconnect and HA ports are cabled on to the cluster/HA switch.

You must have contacted your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

Be sure to check the direction of the cable pull-tabs when inserting the cables in the ports. Cable pull-tabs are up for all networking module ports.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_up.png[]

NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

.Steps
. Use the animation or illustration to complete the cabling between the controllers and to the switches:

image:../media/drw_9000_switched_cluster_cabling.png[]

. Go to <<Step 4: Cable controllers to drive shelves>> for drive shelf cabling instructions.

== Step 4: Cable controllers to drive shelves
You can cable your new system to DS212C, DS224C, or NS224 shelves, depending on if it is an AFF or FAS system.

=== Option 1: Cable the controllers to DS212C or DS224C drive shelves

You must cable the shelf-to-shelf connections, and then cable both controllers to the DS212C or DS224C drive shelves.

The cables are inserted into the drive shelf with the pull-tabs facing down, while the other end of the cable is inserted into the controller storage modules with the pull-tabs up.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_up.png[]

.Steps
. Use the following animations or illustrations to cable your drive shelves to your controllers.
+
NOTE: The examples use DS224C shelves. Cabling is similar with other supported SAS drive shelves.

+
. Go to <<Step 5: Complete system setup and configuration>> to complete system setup and configuration.

=== Option 2: Cable the controllers to a single NS224 drive shelf in AFF A700 and ASA AFF A700 systems running ONTAP 9.8 and later only

You must cable each controller to the NSM modules on the NS224 drive shelf on an AFF A700 or ASA AFF A700 running system ONTAP 9.8 or later.

* This task applies to AFF A700 and ASA AFF A700 running ONTAP 9.8 or later only.
* The systems must have at least one X91148A module installed in slots 3 and/or 7 for each controller. The animation or illustrations show this module installed in both slots 3 and 7.
* Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation. The cable pull-tab for the storage modules are up, while the pull tabs on the shelves are down.
+

+
image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.png[]
+
NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

.Steps
. Use the following animation or illustrations to cable your controllers with two X91148A storage modules to a single NS224 drive shelf, or use the diagram to cable your controllers with one X91148A storage module to a single NS224 drive shelf.
+

. Go to <<Step 5: Complete system setup and configuration>> to complete system setup and configuration.

=== Option 3: Cable the controllers to two NS224 drive shelves in AFF A700 and ASA AFF A700 systems running ONTAP 9.8 and later only

You must cable each controller to the NSM modules on the NS224 drive shelves on an AFF A700 or ASA AFF A700 running system ONTAP 9.8 or later.

* This task applies to AFF A700 and ASA AFF A700 running ONTAP 9.8 or later only.
* The systems must have two X91148A modules, per controller, installed in slots 3 and 7.
* Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation. The cable pull-tab for the storage modules are up, while the pull tabs on the shelves are down.

. Go to <<Step 5: Complete system setup and configuration>> to complete system setup and configuration.

== Step 5: Complete system setup and configuration

You can complete the system setup and configuration using cluster discovery with only a connection to the switch and laptop, or by connecting directly to a controller in the system and then connecting to the management switch.

=== Option 1: Completing system setup and configuration if network discovery is enabled

If you have network discovery enabled on your laptop, you can complete system setup and configuration using automatic cluster discovery.

.Steps
. Use the following animation to set one or more drive shelf IDs:
+
If your system has NS224 drive shelves, the shelves are pre-set to shelf ID 00 and 01. If you want to change the shelf IDs, you must create a tool to insert into the hole where button is located.
+

. Plug the power cords into the controller power supplies, and then connect them to power sources on different circuits.
. Turn on the power switches to both nodes.
+
