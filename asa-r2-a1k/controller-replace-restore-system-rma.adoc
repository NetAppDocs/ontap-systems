To complete the controller replacement for your ASA A1K system, first restore the NetApp Storage Encryption configuration (if necessary) and install the required licenses on the new controller. Next, confirm that the logical interfaces (LIFs) are reporting to their home ports and perform a cluster health check. Finally, register the new controllerâ€™s serial number and then return the failed part to NetApp.


== Step 1: Install licenses for the replacement controller in ONTAP
