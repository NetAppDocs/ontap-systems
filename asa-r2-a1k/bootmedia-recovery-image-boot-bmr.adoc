Restore the ONTAP image on the replacement boot media in your ASA A1K system. The process involves initiating the boot recovery process from the LOADER prompt and monitoring the recovery process until it completes and the node reboots.

During the recovery process, the system checks whether encryption is enabled and determines the type of key encryption in use. If key encryption is enabled, the system guides you through the appropriate steps to restore it.
