Learn what's new for ONTAP hardware systems.

== ASA r2 systems: ASA A1K, ASA A70, and ASA A90
The new NetApp ASA r2 systems (ASA A1K, ASA A70, and ASA A90) deliver a unified hardware and software solution that creates a simplified experience specific to the needs of SAN-only customers. 

On an ASA r2 system, ONTAP software and System Manager are streamlined to provide support for essential SAN functionality while removing visibility of features and functions not supported in SAN environments.
