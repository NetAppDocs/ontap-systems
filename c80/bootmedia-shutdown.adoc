After completing the NVE or NSE tasks, you need to complete the shutdown of the impaired controller. Shut down or take over the impaired controller using the appropriate procedure for your configuration.

If your storage system is running ONTAP 9.17.1 or later, use the link:bootmedia-replace-workflow-bmr.html[automated boot recovery procedure]. If your system is running an earlier version of ONTAP, you must use the manual boot recovery procedure.
