After you install the rack hardware for your AFX storage system, install the network cables for the controllers, and connect the cables between the controllers and storage shelves.

.Before you begin

Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the storage system to your network switches.

.About this task
* These procedures show common configurations. The specific cabling depends on the components ordered for your storage system. For comprehensive configuration details and slot priorities, see link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^].
* The I/O slots on an AFX controller are numbered 1 through 11.

* The cabling graphics have arrow icons showing the proper orientation (up or down) of the cable connector pull-tab when inserting a connector into a port.
+
As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it over and try again.

* If cabling to an optical switch, insert the optical transceiver into the controller port before cabling to the switch port.

== Step 1: Connect the controllers to the management network
Use the 1000BASE-T RJ-45 cables to connect the management (wrench) ports on each controller to the management network switches.

IMPORTANT: Do not plug in the power cords yet. 

== Step 2: Connect the controllers to the host network
Connect the Ethernet module ports to your host network. 

This procedure differs depending on your storage system model and I/O module configuration. The following are some typical host network cabling examples. See  link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for your specific system configuration.

.Steps

. Connect ports e9a and e9b to your Ethernet data network switch.
+
NOTE: For maximum system performance for cluster and HA traffic, do not use ports e1b and e7b ports for host network connections.  Use a separate host card to maximize performance.

== Step 3: Cable the controller-to-switch connections
Connect the controller to the switches.

Use the 100 GbE cable to connect ports e1a to e1a and ports e7a to e7a.

.Steps

. Connect port e1a on Controller A and port e1a on Controller B to cluster network switch A. 
. Connect port e7a on Controller A and port e7a on Controller B to cluster network switch B.

== Step 4: Cable the shelf-to-switch connections
Connect the shelf to the switches.
