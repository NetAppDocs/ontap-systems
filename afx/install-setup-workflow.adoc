To install and configure your AFX 1K storage system, you review the hardware requirements, prepare your site, install the switches, install and cable the hardware components, power on the system, and set up your ONTAP cluster.

To prepare to install your AFX 1K storage system, you need to get the site ready, check the environmental and electrical requirements, and ensure there's enough rack space. Then, unpack the equipment, compare its contents to the packing slip, and register the hardware to access support benefits.

To install the hardware, install the rail kits for your storage system and shelves, and then install and secure your storage system in the cabinet or telco rack. Next, slide the shelves onto the rails. Finally, attach cable management devices to the rear of the storage system for organized cable routing.

Before you power on the controller nodes, power on each storage shelf and assign a unique shelf ID to ensure each shelf is uniquely identified within the setup.
