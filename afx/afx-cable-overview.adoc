Learn how to cable your controllers to the network, switches, and drive shelves. 

The initial configuration of the AFX 1k storage system supports four nodes connected through dual switches to the drive shelves. Additional nodes and disk shelves can be utilized to expand on the initial AFX 1K storage system configuration. Expanded AFX 1k configurations follow the same switch-based cabling methodology as the four node schema depicted below.
