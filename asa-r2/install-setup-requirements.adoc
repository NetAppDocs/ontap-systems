Get started with the install and setup workflow for the ASA r2 storage system and deploy it as a node in your ONTAP environment. 

== Equipement needed for install
Before installing your storage system, confirm you have all of the additional equipment and tools that you need.

** Phillips #2 screwdriver 
** Flashlight
** ESD strap 
** A paperclip or narrow tipped ball point pen for setting NS224 shelf IDs
** Laptop or console with a USB/serial connection
** Access to a Web browser to configure your storage system

== Lifting precautions 
You should be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the platform and shelves.

=== Shelf weight
A fully loaded shelf can weigh up to 66.78 lbs (30.29 kg) and requires two people to lift or use a hydraulic lift. Avoid removing shelf components (from the front or rear of the shelf) to reduce the shelf weight, because shelf weight will become unbalanced.
