[.lead]
If one or both of the fans in your fan module fail, you can replace your fan module. This procedure can be completed nondisruptively in an NX224 shelf that is powered on with I/O in progress.


.About this task

* Allow at least 70 seconds between removal and installation of the NVMe shelf module (NSM).
+
This allows enough time for ONTAP to process the NSM removal event.

* *Best practice:* The best practice is to have current versions of NSM firmware and drive firmware on your system before replacing FRU components. You can visit the NetApp Support Site to https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/downloads/firmware/disk-shelf-firmware[download disk shelf firmware^] and https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/downloads/firmware/disk-drive-firmware[download disk drive firmware^].
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not revert firmware to a version that does not support your shelf and its components.
====

* If needed, you can turn on the shelf's location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the affected shelf: `storage shelf location-led modify -shelf-name _shelf_name_ -led-status on`
+
If you do not know the `_shelf_name_` of the affected shelf, run the `storage shelf show` command.
+
A shelf has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each NSM. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. You can turn them off by entering the same command, but using the `off` option.

* When you unpack the replacement fan, save all packing materials for use when you return the failed fan.
+
If you need the RMA number or additional help with the replacement procedure, contact technical support at https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support^], 888-463-8277 (North America), 00-800-44-638277 (Europe), or +800-800-80-800 (Asia/Pacific).


.Before you begin

The shelf's partner NSM must be up and running and cabled correctly so that your shelf maintains connectivity when you remove the NSM with the failed FRU (target NSM). You can verify the partner NSM's status by https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[downloading and running Config Advisor^].


.Steps

. Properly ground yourself.
. Disconnect the cabling from the NSM that contains the FRU that you are replacing:
 .. Disconnect the power cord from the power supply by opening the power cord retainer and then unplugging the power cord from the power supply.
+
Power supplies do not have a power switch.

 .. Disconnect the shelf cabling from the NSM ports.
+
Make a note of the NSM ports that each cable is connected to. You reconnect the cables to the same ports when you reinsert the NSM later in this procedure.

. Open the NSM cover by turning the thumbscrew counterclockwise to loosen, and then open the cover.
+
NOTE: The FRU label on the NSM cover shows the location of the five fans, along the rear wall of the NSM.

. Physically identify the failed fan.
+
When a fan fails, the system logs a warning message to the system console indicating which fan failed.

. Replace the failed fan:

Remove the failed fan by firmly grasping the sides where the blue touch points are located, and then pull it straight up out of its socket.

Insert the replacement fan by aligning it within the guides, and then push down until the fan connector is fully seated in the socket.

. Close the NSM cover, and then tighten the thumb screw.

include::../_include/t_module_reinstall.adoc[]

. Reconnect the cabling to the NSM:
 .. Reconnect the shelf cabling to the same eight NSM ports.
+
Cables are inserted with the connector pull-tab facing up. When a cable is inserted correctly, it clicks into place.

 .. Reconnect the power cord to the power supply, and then secure the power cord with the power cord retainer.
+
When functioning correctly, a power supply's bicolored LED illuminates green.
+
Additionally, both NSM port LNK (green) LEDs illuminate. If a LNK LED does not illuminate, reseat the cable.
. Verify that the attention (amber) LEDs on the NSM containing the failed fan and the shelf operator display panel are no longer illuminated.
+
The NSM attention LEDs turn off after the NSM reboots and no longer detects a fan issue. This can take three to five minutes.

. Verify that the NSM is cabled correctly, by https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[running Active IQ Config Advisor^].
+
If any cabling errors are generated, follow the corrective actions provided.
