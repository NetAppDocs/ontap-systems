If you disabled automatic drive assignment as part of the preparation for the NX224 shelf hot-add, you need to manually assign drive ownership and then reenable automatic drive assignment, if needed.

.Before you begin

You must have already cabled your shelf as instructed for your HA pair. See link:cable-overview-hot-add-shelf.html[Overview of cabling for a hot-add].

.Steps

. Display all unowned drives: `storage disk show -container-type unassigned`
+
You can enter the command on either controller.

. Assign each drive: `storage disk assign -disk _disk_name_ -owner _owner_name_`
+
You can enter the command on either controller.
+
You can use the wild card character to assign more than one drive at once.

. Reenable automatic drive assignment if needed: `storage disk option modify -node _node_name_ -autoassign on`
+
You must reenable automatic drive assignment on both controllers.
