You need to install an NX224 shelf in a cabinet or telco rack, connect the power cords (which automatically powers on the shelf), and set the shelf ID.

.Before you begin 

* Make sure your have a paper clip with one side straightened or a narrow-tipped ballpoint pen.
+
To change the shelf ID, you use the paper clip or ballpoint pen to access the shelf ID button behind the Operator Display Panel (ODP) for the change shelf ID step.

* Understand that a fully loaded NX224 shelf can weigh up to 66.78 lbs (30.29 kg) with NSM100 modules or an average of 56.8 lbs (25.8 kg) with NSM100B modules and requires two people to lift or use of a hydraulic lift. Avoid removing shelf components (from the front or rear of the shelf) to reduce the shelf weight, because shelf weight will become unbalanced.

.Steps

. Install the rail kit for the shelf, as needed, using the instructions included with the kit.
+
NOTE: Always use the appropriate rail kit for your shelf to install the shelf in a rack or cabinet.

. Install the shelf:
+
.. Position the back of the shelf onto the rails, and then support the shelf from the bottom and slide it into the cabinet or telco rack.
+
If you are installing multiple shelves, place the first shelf directly above the controllers. Place the second shelf directly under the controllers. Repeat this pattern for any additional shelves.
+
.. Secure the shelf to the cabinet or telco rack using the mounting screws included in the kit.
+
. Connect the power:
+
.. Connect the power cords to the shelf and secure them in place.
+
If they are AC power supplies, secure them in place with the power cord retainer.
+
If they are DC power supplies, secure them in place with the two thumb screws.
+
.. Connect the power cords to different power sources for resiliency.
+
A shelf powers up when connected to a power source; it does not have power switches. When functioning correctly, a power supply's bicolored LED illuminates green.

. Set the shelf ID to a number that is unique within the HA pair:

|===
.. Remove the left end cap and locate the small hole to the right of the LEDs.
.. Insert the end of a paper clip or similar tool into the small hole to reach the shelf ID button.
.. Press and hold the button (for up to 15 seconds) until the first number on the digital display blinks, and then release the button.
+
If the ID takes longer than 15 seconds to blink, press and hold the button again, making sure to press it in all the way.
+
.. Press and release the button to advance the number until you reach the desired number from 0 to 9.
.. Repeat substeps 4c and 4d to set the second number of the shelf ID.
+
It can take up to three seconds (instead of 15 seconds) for the number to blink.

.. Press and hold the button until the second number stops blinking.
+
After about five seconds, both numbers start blinking and the amber LED on the ODP illuminates.

.. Power-cycle the shelf to make the shelf ID take effect.
+
You must unplug both power cords from the shelf, wait 10 seconds, and then plug them back in.
+
When power is restored to the power supplies, their bicolored LEDs illuminate green.
