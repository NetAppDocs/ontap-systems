For ONTAP hardware systems, you can perform maintenance procedures on the following field replaceable unit (FRU) components.

== Boot media

The boot media stores a primary and secondary set of boot image files that the system uses when it boots.

== Caching module

You must replace the controller's caching module when your system registers a single AutoSupport (ASUP) message that the module has gone offline.

* link:../caching-module-fru-links.html[Caching module replacement procedures by platform^]

== Chassis

The chassis is the physical enclosure housing all the controller components, such as the controller/CPU unit, power supply, and I/O.

* link:../chassis-fru-links.html[Chassis replacement procedures by platform^]

== Controller

A controller consists of a board, firmware, and software. It controls the drives and implements the ONTAP functions.

== DCPM power module

The data center persistent memory (DCPM) power module provides backup power for DCPM modules during unexpected power loss events.

== DIMM

You must replace a DIMM (dual in-line memory module) when a memory mismatch is present, or you have a failed DIMM.

* link:../dimm-fru-links.html[DIMM replacement procedures by platform^]

== Drive

A drive is a device that provides the physical storage media for data.

* link:../drive-fru-links.html[Drive replacement procedures by platform^]

== Fan

A fan provides airflow for cooling system components and maintaining proper operating temperatures.

* link:../fan-fru-links.html[Fan replacement procedures by platform^]

== IO module

An I/O module provides network and storage connectivity interfaces for the controller.

* link:../io-module-fru-links.html[IO module replacement procedures by platform^]

== LED module

The LED module provides visual status indicators for system health and component status.

* link:../led-module-fru-links.html[LED module replacement procedures by platform^]

== Mezzanine

A mezzanine card provides additional I/O connectivity and expansion capabilities for the controller.

* link:../mezzanine-fru-links.html[Mezzanine replacement procedures by platform^]

== NVDIMM

You must replace an NVDIMM (non-volatile dual in-line memory module) when the module fails or shows errors.

* link:../nvdimm-fru-links.html[NVDIMM replacement procedures by platform^]

== NVMEM/NVRAM battery

A battery is included with a controller and preserves cached data if the AC power fails.

* link:../nvmem-battery-fru-links.html[NVMEM/NVRAM battery replacement procedures by platform^]

== NVRAM module

The NVRAM module provides non-volatile storage for system metadata and cached write data.

* link:../nvram-module-fru-links.html[NVRAM module replacement procedures by platform^]

== PCI cards and risers

PCI cards and risers provide expansion slots for additional functionality and I/O connectivity.

* link:../pci-cards-fru-links.html[PCI cards and risers replacement procedures by platform^]

== Power supply

A power supply provides a redundant power source in a controller shelf.

* link:../power-supply-fru-links.html[Power supply replacement procedures by platform^]

== RTC battery

A real-time clock battery preserves system date and time information if the power is off.

* link:../rtc-battery-fru-links.html[RTC battery replacement procedures by platform^]

== System management module

The system management module provides out-of-band management capabilities for the system.
