For ONTAP hardware systems, you can perform maintenance procedures on the following field replaceable unit (FRU) components.

|===
| FRU procedure | Description

| link:bootmedia-fru-links.html[Boot media replacement procedures by platform^] | The boot media stores a primary and secondary set of boot image files that the system uses when it boots.
| link:caching-module-fru-links.html[Caching module replacement procedures by platform^] | You must replace the controller's caching module when your system registers a single AutoSupport (ASUP) message that the module has gone offline.
| link:chassis-fru-links.html[Chassis replacement procedures by platform^] | The chassis is the physical enclosure housing all the controller components, such as the controller/CPU unit, power supply, and I/O.
| link:controller-fru-links.html[Controller replacement procedures by platform^] | A controller consists of a board, firmware, and software. It controls the drives and implements the ONTAP functions.
| link:dcpm-power-fru-links.html[DCPM power module replacement procedures by platform^] | The data center persistent memory (DCPM) power module provides backup power for DCPM modules during unexpected power loss events.
| link:dimm-fru-links.html[DIMM replacement procedures by platform^] | You must replace a DIMM (dual in-line memory module) when a memory mismatch is present, or you have a failed DIMM.
| link:drive-fru-links.html[Drive replacement procedures by platform^] | A drive is a device that provides the physical storage media for data.
| link:fan-fru-links.html[Fan replacement procedures by platform^] | A fan provides airflow for cooling system components and maintaining proper operating temperatures.
| link:io-module-fru-links.html[IO module replacement procedures by platform^] | An I/O module provides network and storage connectivity interfaces for the controller.
| link:led-module-fru-links.html[LED module replacement procedures by platform^] | The LED module provides visual status indicators for system health and component status.
| link:mezzanine-fru-links.html[Mezzanine replacement procedures by platform^] | A mezzanine card provides additional I/O connectivity and expansion capabilities for the controller.
| link:nvdimm-fru-links.html[NVDIMM replacement procedures by platform^] | You must replace an NVDIMM (non-volatile dual in-line memory module) when the module fails or shows errors.
| link:nvmem-battery-fru-links.html[NVMEM/NVRAM battery replacement procedures by platform^] | A battery is included with a controller and preserves cached data if the AC power fails.
| link:nvram-module-fru-links.html[NVRAM module replacement procedures by platform^] | The NVRAM module provides non-volatile storage for system metadata and cached write data.
| link:pci-cards-fru-links.html[PCI cards and risers replacement procedures by platform^] | PCI cards and risers provide expansion slots for additional functionality and I/O connectivity.
| link:power-supply-fru-links.html[Power supply replacement procedures by platform^] | A power supply provides a redundant power source in a controller shelf.
| link:rtc-battery-fru-links.html[RTC battery replacement procedures by platform^] | A real-time clock battery preserves system date and time information if the power is off.
| link:system-management-fru-links.html[System management module replacement procedures by platform^] | The system management module provides out-of-band management capabilities for the system.
