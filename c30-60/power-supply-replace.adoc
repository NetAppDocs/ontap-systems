Replace an AC or DC power supply unit (PSU) in your AFF C30 or AFF C60 system when it fails or becomes faulty, ensuring that your system continues to receive the required power for stable operation. The replacement process involves disconnecting the target PSU from the power source, unplugging the power cord, removing the faulty PSU and installing the replacement PSU, and then reconnecting it to the power source.
