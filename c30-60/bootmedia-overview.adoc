You can replace a failed boot media manually by using a USB module for the boot image.

Manual boot media replace uses the traditional method of downloading the ONTAP image from the NetApp support site, transferring the image to a USB drive, downloading it to the target replacement boot media, and manually walking through the boot menu options to install the ONTAP image on the replacement boot media.
