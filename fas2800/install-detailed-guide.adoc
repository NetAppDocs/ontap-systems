This procedure gives detailed step-by-step instructions for installing a typical NetApp storage system. Use this procedure if you want more detailed installation instructions.

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

.Before you begin

You need to provide the following at your site:

* Rack space for the storage system in either a telco rack or system cabinet.
** 2U for the storage system
** 2U or 4U for each drive shelf in your system
* Phillips #2 screwdriver
* Additional networking cables to connect your storage system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser
* A laptop or console with an RJ-45 connection and access to a Web browser
** Access to the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe] for information about site requirements as well as additional information on your configured storage system. 
**  You might also want to have access to the http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[Release Notes for your version of ONTAP 9] for your version of ONTAP for more information about this storage system.

.Steps
. Unpack all boxes and inventory the contents.
+
IMPORTANT: Customers with specific power requirements must check https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe] for their configuration options.
+
. Access the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_configure_ontap.html#assign-a-node-management-ip-address[Configure ONTAP on a new cluster with System Manager^]
.. Review the requirements amd procedure steps.
.. Gather information about your storage system by completing the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_configure_ontap.html[setup worksheet^ (need the URL to the worksheet)].
.. Record the storage system serial number from the controllers.

== Step 2: Install the hardware

Install your storage system in a telco rack or NetApp storage system cabinet, as applicable.

.Steps
. Install the rail kits, as needed.
. Install and secure your storage system using the instructions included with the rail kit.
+
NOTE: You need to be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the storage system.
+
image::../media/oie_fas2800_weight_caution_IEOPS-1070.svg[width=320px]

. Attach cable management devices (as shown).
+
image::../media/drw_cable_management_arm_install.svg[width=320px]

. Place the bezel on the front of the storage system.

== Step 3: Cable controllers to your network

Cable the controllers to your network as either a two-node switchless cluster or a switched cluster.

The following table identifies the cable type with the call out number and cable color in the illustrations for both two-node switchless cluster and switched cluster.

.Before you begin

* Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the storage system to the switches.
* Check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.
** As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn the cable head over and try again.
** If connecting to an optical switch, insert the SFP into the controller port before cabling to the port.
