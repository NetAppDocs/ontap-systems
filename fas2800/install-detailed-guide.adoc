This guide gives detailed step-by-step instructions for installing a typical NetApp system. Use this guide if you want more detailed installation instructions.

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

To install your FAS2800 system, you need to create an account on the NetApp Support Site, register your system, and get license keys. You also need to inventory the appropriate number and type of cables for your system and collect specific network information.

You need to have access to the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe] for information about site requirements as well as additional information on your configured system. You might also want to have access to the http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[Release Notes for your version of ONTAP 9] for your version of ONTAP for more information about this system.

You need to provide the following at your site:

* Rack space for the storage system
* Phillips #2 screwdriver
* Additional networking cables to connect your system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser
* A laptop or console with an RJ-45 connection and access to a Web browser

.Steps
. Unpack the contents of all boxes.
. Record the system serial number from the controllers.
+

. Set up your account:
.. Log in to your existing account or create an account.
.. Register your system through  https://mysupport.netapp.com/eservice/registerSNoAction.do?moduleName=RegisterMyProduct[NetApp Product Registration]
. Download and install https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[Config Advisor] on your laptop.

. Inventory and make a note of the number and types of cables you received.
+
The following table identifies the types of cables you might receive. If you receive a cable not listed in the table, see the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe] to locate the cable and identify its use.

== Step 2: Install the hardware

You need to install your system in a 4-post rack or NetApp system cabinet, as applicable.

.Steps
. Install the rail kits, as needed.
. Install and secure your system using the instructions included with the rail kit.
+
NOTE: You need to be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the system.
+

.Option 1: Cable a two-node switchless cluster
--

Cable your network connections and your cluster interconnect ports for a two-node switchless cluster.


.Before you begin
Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.svg[width=320px]

NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn the cable head over and try again.

NOTE: If connecting to an optical switch, insert the SFP into the controller port before cabling to the port.

== Step 4: Cable controllers to drive shelves

Cable your controllers to external storage.

NOTE: The example uses DS224C. Cabling is similar with other supported drive shelves.


Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.svg[width=320px]

.About this task

You can use the graphic or the step-by step instructions to complete the cabling between the controllers and to the drive shelves.

== Step 5: Complete system setup and configuration

You can complete the system setup and configuration using cluster discovery with only a connection to the switch and laptop, or by connecting directly to a controller in the system and then connecting to the management switch.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Option 1: If network discovery is enabled
--

If network discovery enabled on your laptop, complete system setup and configuration using automatic cluster discovery.

.Steps
. Use the following animation to set one or more drive shelf IDs
+
video::c600f366-4d30-481a-89d9-ab1b0066589b[panopto, title="Animation - Set drive shelf IDs"]

. Plug the power cords into the controller power supplies, and then connect them to power sources on different circuits.
. Turn on the power switches to both nodes.
+
image::../media/dwr_2800_turn_on_power_IEOPS-898.svg[width=500px]
+
NOTE: Initial booting may take up to eight minutes.

. Make sure that your laptop has network discovery enabled.
+
See your laptop's online help for more information.

. Use the following animation to connect your laptop to the Management switch.
+
video::d61f983e-f911-4b76-8b3a-ab1b0066909b[panopto, title="Animation - Connect your laptop to the Management switch"]

If network discovery is not enabled on your laptop, manually complete the configuration and setup.

.Steps
. Cable and configure your laptop or console:
 .. Set the console port on the laptop or console to 115,200 baud with N-8-1.
+
NOTE: See your laptop or console's online help for how to configure the console port.

 .. Connect the console cable to the laptop or console, and connect the console port on the controller using the console cable that came with your system, and then cConnect the laptop or console to the switch on the management subnet.
+
image::../media/drw_2800_laptop_to_switch_to_controller_IEOPS-1084.svg[width=600px]
