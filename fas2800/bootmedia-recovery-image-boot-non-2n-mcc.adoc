.. Press `y` when prompted to restore the backup configuration.
.. Set the healthy node to advanced privilege level: `set -privilege advanced`
.. Run the restore backup command: `system node restore-backup -node local -target-address impaired_node_IP_address`
.. Return the node to admin level: `set -privilege admin`
.. Press `y` when prompted to confirm if the restore backup was successful.
.. Press `y` when prompted to restore the configuration copy.
.. Press `y` when prompted to reboot the node.

 .. Press `n` when prompted to restore the backup configuration.
 .. Reboot the system when prompted by the system.
 .. Select the *Update flash from backup config* (sync flash) option from the displayed menu.
+
If you are prompted to continue with the update, press `y`.

. Ensure that the environmental variables are set as expected:
.. Take the controller to the LOADER prompt.
.. Check the environment variable settings with the `printenv` command.
.. If an environment variable is not set as expected, modify it with the `setenv __environment-variable-name__ __changed-value__` command.
.. Save your changes using the `savenv` command.
. The next depends on your system configuration:
** If your system has onboard keymanager, NSE or NVE configured, go to xref:bootmedia-encryption-restore.adoc[Restore OKM, NSE, and NVE as needed]
** If your system does not have onboard keymanager, NSE or NVE configured, complete the steps in this section.
. From the LOADER prompt, enter the `boot_ontap` command.

.. Log into the partner controller.
.. Confirm the target controller is ready for giveback with the `storage failover show` command.


|===

. Connect the console cable to the partner controller.
. Give back the controller using the `storage failover giveback -fromnode local` command.
. At the cluster prompt, check the logical interfaces with the `net int show -is-home false` command.
+
If any interfaces are listed as "false", revert those interfaces back to their home port using the `net int revert -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif _lif_name_` command.

. Move the console cable to the repaired controller and run the `version -v` command to check the ONTAP versions.
. If you are not using storage encryption, restore automatic giveback and AutoSupport:
.. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.
.. If an AutoSupport maintenance window was triggered, end it by using the `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=END` command.
