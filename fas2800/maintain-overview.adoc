[.lead]
Maintain the hardware of your FAS2820 storage system to ensure long-term reliability and optimal performance. Perform regular maintenance tasks such as replacing faulty components, as this helps prevent downtime and data loss. 

The maintenance procedures assume that the FAS2820 storage system has already been deployed as a storage node in the ONTAP environment.

a| link:bootmedia-replace-workflow-bmr.html[Boot media - automated recovery]

a| The boot media stores a primary and secondary set of ONTAP image files that the storage system uses to boot. During automated recovery, the system retrieves the boot image from the partner node and automatically runs the appropriate boot menu option to install the image on your replacement boot media. The automated boot media recovery process is supported only in ONTAP 9.17.1 and later. If your storage system is running an earlier version of ONTAP, use the link:bootmedia-replace-workflow.html[manual boot recovery procedure].
