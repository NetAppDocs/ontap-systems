To complete the replacement procedure and restore your system to full operation, you must recable the storage, confirm disk reassignment, restore the NetApp Storage Encryption configuration (if necessary), and install licenses for the new controller. You must complete a series of tasks before restoring your system to full operation.

== Step 1: Recable the system

include::../_include/recable_system_after_controller_rep.adoc[]

== Step 2: Reassign disks

You must confirm the system ID change when you boot the _replacement_ controller and then verify that the change was implemented.

. If the _replacement_ controller is in Maintenance mode (showing the `*>` prompt, exit Maintenance mode and go to the LOADER prompt: `halt`
. From the LOADER prompt on the _replacement_ controller, boot the controller, entering `y` if you are prompted to override the system ID due to a system ID mismatch:``boot_ontap``
. Wait until the `Waiting for giveback...` message is displayed on the _replacement_ controller console and then, from the healthy controller, verify that the new partner system ID has been automatically assigned: `storage failover show`
+
In the command output, you should see a message that the system ID has changed on the impaired controller, showing the correct old and new IDs. In the following example, node2 has undergone replacement and has a new system ID of 151759706.

                                                  151759755, New: 151759706), In takeover
node2             node1             -            Waiting for giveback (HA mailboxes)

. From the healthy controller, verify that any coredumps are saved:
 .. Change to the advanced privilege level: `set -privilege advanced`
+
You can respond `Y` when prompted to continue into advanced mode. The advanced mode prompt appears (*>).

 .. Save any coredumps: `system node run -node _local-node-name_ partner savecore`
 .. Wait for the `savecore` command to complete before issuing the giveback.
+
You can enter the following command to monitor the progress of the savecore command: `system node run -node _local-node-name_ partner savecore -s`

 .. Return to the admin privilege level: `set -privilege admin`
. Give back the controller:
 .. From the healthy controller, give back the replaced controller's storage: `storage failover giveback -ofnode _replacement_node_name_`
+
The _replacement_ controller takes back its storage and completes booting.
+
If you are prompted to override the system ID due to a system ID mismatch, you should enter `y`.
+
IMPORTANT: If the giveback is vetoed, resolve the veto issue. If the veto is not critical to resolve, you can override the veto.

 .. After the giveback has been completed, confirm that the HA pair is healthy and that takeover is possible: `storage failover show`
+
The output from the `storage failover show` command should not include the System ID changed on partner message.
. Verify that the disks were assigned correctly: `storage disk show -ownership`
+
The disks belonging to the _replacement_ controller should show the new system ID. In the following example, the disks owned by node1 now show the new system ID, 1873775277:
