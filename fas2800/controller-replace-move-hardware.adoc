. Locate the DIMMs on your controller module
+
NOTE: Note the location of the DIMM in the sockets so that you can insert the DIMM in the same location in the replacement controller module and in the proper orientation.

. Remove the DIMMs from the impaired controller module:
.. Eject the DIMM from its slot by slowly pushing apart the two DIMM ejector tabs on either side of the DIMM.
+
The DIMM will rotate up a little.
.. Rotate the DIMM as far as it will go, and then slide the DIMM out of the socket. 
+
NOTE: Carefully hold the DIMM by the edges to avoid pressure on the components on the DIMM circuit board.
. Verify that the NVMEM battery is not plugged into the replacement controller module.
. Install the DIMMs in the replacement controller in the same place they were in the impaired controller:
.. Push carefully, but firmly, on the top edge of the DIMM until the ejector tabs snap into place over the notches at the ends of the DIMM.
+
The DIMM fits tightly in the slot, but should go in easily. If not, realign the DIMM with the slot and reinsert it.
+
NOTE: Visually inspect the DIMM to verify that it is evenly aligned and fully inserted into the slot.

. Repeat these steps for the other DIMM.

+
If necessary, remove the caching module and reseat it into the socket.
.. Push the blue locking button, rotate the caching module all the way down, and then release the locking button to lock the caching module in place.
. Plug in the NVMEM battery. 
+
Make sure that the plug locks down into the battery power socket on the motherboard.
+
NOTE: If plugging in the battery is difficult, remove the battery from the controller module, plug it in, and then reinstall the battery into the controller module.  
+
. Reinstall the controller module cover. 

== Step 8: Install the NV battery

Install the NV battery into the replacement controller module. 

. Plug the battery plug back into the socket on the controller module.
+
Make sure that the plug locks down into the battery socket on the motherboard.  
+
. Aligning the battery with the holding brackets on the sheet metal side wall.
. Slide the battery pack down until the battery latch engages and clicks into the opening on the side wall.
. Reinstall the controller module cover and lock it into place. 

== Step 9: Install the controller

Install the replacement controller module into the system chassis and boot ONTAP.

NOTE: The system might update system firmware when it boots. Do not abort this process. The procedure requires you to interrupt the boot process, which you can typically do at any time after prompted to do so. However, if the system updates the system firmware when it boots, you must wait until after the update is complete before interrupting the boot process.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. If you have not already done so, replace the cover on the controller module.
. Turn the controller module. 
. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Complete the reinstallation of the controller module:
 .. With the cam handle in the open position, firmly push the controller module in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated, and then close the cam handle to the locked position.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
+
The controller begins to boot as soon as it is seated in the chassis.

.. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
.. Bind the cables to the cable management device with the hook and loop strap.
+
NOTE: You must look for an Automatic firmware update console message. If the update message appears, do not press `Ctrl-C` to interrupt the boot process until after you see a message confirming that the update is complete. If the firmware update is aborted, the boot process exits to the LOADER prompt. You must run the `update_flash` command, and then enter `bye -g` to reboot the system.

*Important:* During the boot process, you might see the following prompts:

 ** A prompt warning of a system ID mismatch and asking to override the system ID. Respond `y` to this prompt.
 ** A prompt warning that when entering Maintenance mode in an HA configuration you must ensure that the healthy controller remains down. Respond `y` to this prompt.
