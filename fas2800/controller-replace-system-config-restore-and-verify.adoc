After completing the hardware replacement and booting the replacement controller, verify the low-level system configuration of the replacement controller and reconfigure system settings as necessary.

== Step 1: Set and verify system time after replacing the controller

include::../_include/set_time_after_controller_rep.adoc[]

== Step 2:  Verify and set the HA state of the controller module

You must verify the `HA` state of the controller module and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

. In Maintenance mode from the new controller module, verify that all components display the same `HA` state: `ha-config show`
+
The HA state should be the same for all components.

. If the displayed system state for the controller does not match your system configuration, set the HA state for the replacement controller module: `ha-config modify controller _HA-state_`
+
The value for HA-state can be one of the following:

*** `ha`
*** `mcc`
*** `mcc-2n`
*** `mccip`

.. Confirm that the setting has changed: `ha-config show`
. Reboot the controller module.

+
NOTE: During the boot process, you might see the following prompts:
+
* A prompt warning of a system ID mismatch and asking to override the system ID.
* A prompt warning that when entering Maintenance mode in an HA configuration you must ensure that the healthy controller remains down.
You can safely respond `y` to these prompts.
