To get up and running with ONTAP hardware systems, you install hardware components, cable your hardware, and configure your storage in ONTAP.

If your system is in a MetroCluster configuration, go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/index.html[MetroCluster doc site] and follow the install instructions applicable to your MetroCluster configuration type.

Use the following workflow to deploy your storage system when it is not set up in a MetroCluster configuration.
