To replace the boot media, you must remove the impaired controller module, install the replacement boot media, and transfer the boot image to a USB flash drive.

If your storage system is running ONTAP 9.17.1 or later, use the link:bootmedia-replace-workflow-bmr.html[automated boot recovery procedure]. If your system is running an earlier version of ONTAP, you must use the manual boot recovery procedure.
