You must review the prerequisites for the replacement procedure and select the correct one for your version of the ONTAP operating system.

* All drive shelves must be working properly.
* If your system has a V_StorageAttach license, you must refer to the additional required steps before performing this procedure.
* If your system is in an HA pair, the healthy node must be able to take over the node that is being replaced (referred to in this procedure as the "`impaired node`").
* If your system is in a MetroCluster configuration, you must review the section https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/disaster-recovery/concept_choosing_the_correct_recovery_procedure_parent_concept.html[Choosing the correct recovery procedure] to determine whether you should use this procedure.

If this is the procedure you should use, note that the controller replacement procedure for a node in a four or eight node MetroCluster configuration is the same as that in an HA pair. No MetroCluster-specific steps are required because the failure is restricted to an HA pair and storage failover commands can be used to provide nondisruptive operation during the replacement.

* You must replace the failed component with a replacement FRU component you received from your provider.
* You must be replacing a controller module with a controller module of the same model type. You cannot upgrade your system by just replacing the controller module.
* You cannot change any drives or drive shelves as part of this procedure.
* In this procedure, the boot device is moved from the impaired node to the _replacement_ node so that the _replacement_ node will boot up in the same version of ONTAP as the old controller module.
* It is important that you apply the commands in these steps on the correct systems:
 ** The _impaired_ node is the node that is being replaced.
 ** The _replacement_ node is the new node that is replacing the impaired node.
 ** The _healthy_ node is the surviving node.
* You must always capture the node's console output to a text file.

This provides you a record of the procedure so that you can troubleshoot any issues that you might encounter during the replacement process.
