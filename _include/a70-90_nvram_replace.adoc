. Set the NVRAM module on a stable surface.
. Remove the DIMMs, one at a time, from the impaired NVRAM module and install them in the replacement NVRAM module.
. Install the replacement NVRAM module into the chassis:
 .. Align the module with the edges of the chassis opening in slot 4/5.
 .. Gently slide the module into the slot all the way, and then push the cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
 
. Plug the power cords into the power supplies. The controller reboots as soon as power is restored.

+
NOTE: If you have DC power supplies, reconnect the power block to the power supplies.

+ 

 . Rotate the cable management tray up to the closed position.

 . Return the impaired controller to normal operation by giving back its storage: `storage failover giveback -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`.

. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` .

. If AutoSupport is enabled, restore/unsuppress automatic case creation: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=END`.

DIMM locking tabs
|===

. Set the NVRAM module on a stable surface.
. Locate the DIMM to be replaced inside the NVRAM module.

+
NOTE: Consult the FRU map label on the side of the NVRAM module to determine the locations of DIMM slots 1 and 2.
+

 . Remove the DIMM by pressing down on the DIMM locking tabs and lifting the DIMM out of the socket.

. Install the replacement DIMM by aligning the DIMM with the socket and gently pushing the DIMM into the socket until the locking tabs lock in place.
. Install the NVRAM module into the chassis:
 .. Gently slide the module into the slot until the cam latch begins to engage with the I/O cam pin, and then rotate the cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. Plug the power cords into the power supplies. The controller reboots as soon as power is restored.

+
NOTE: If you have DC power supplies, reconnect the power block to the power supplies.
+ 


. Rotate the cable management tray up to the closed position.

. Return the impaired controller to normal operation by giving back its storage: `storage failover giveback -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`.

. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`.

. If AutoSupport is enabled, restore/unsuppress automatic case creation: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=END`.

== Step 3: Reassign disks

You must confirm the system ID change when you boot the controller and then verify that the change was implemented.

CAUTION: Disk reassignment is only needed when replacing the NVRAM module and does not apply to NVRAM DIMM replacement. 

.Steps
. If the controller is in Maintenance mode (showing the `*>` prompt), exit Maintenance mode and go to the LOADER prompt: 
+
`halt`
. From the LOADER prompt on the controller, boot the controller and enter _y_ when prompted to override the system ID due to a system ID mismatch.
. Wait until the Waiting for giveback message is displayed on the console of the controller with the replacement module and then, from the healthy controller, verify that the new partner system ID has been automatically assigned: 
+
`storage failover show`
+
In the command output, you should see a message that the system ID has changed on the impaired controller, showing the correct old and new IDs. In the following example, node 2 has undergone replacement and has a new system ID of 151759706.
+
----
node1:> storage failover show
                                    Takeover
Node              Partner           Possible     State Description
------------      ------------      --------     -------------------------------------
node1             node2             false        System ID changed on partner (Old:
                                                  151759755, New: 151759706), In takeover
node2             node1             -            Waiting for giveback (HA mailboxes)
----

. Give back the controller:
 .. From the healthy controller, give back the replaced controller's storage: 
 +
`storage failover giveback -ofnode replacement_node_name`
+
The controller takes back its storage and completes booting.
+
If you are prompted to override the system ID due to a system ID mismatch, you should enter _y_.
+
If the giveback is vetoed, you can consider overriding the vetoes.
+
For more information, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/high-availability/ha_manual_giveback.html#if-giveback-is-interrupted[manual giveback commands^] to override the veto.

 .. After the giveback has been completed, confirm that the HA pair is healthy and that takeover is possible: _storage failover show_
+
The output from the `storage failover show` command should not include the System ID changed on partner message.
. Verify that the disks were assigned correctly: 
+
`storage disk show -ownership`
+
The disks belonging to the controller should show the new system ID. In the following example, the disks owned by node1 now show the new system ID, 151759706:
+
----
node1:> storage disk show -ownership

Disk  Aggregate Home  Owner  DR Home  Home ID    Owner ID  DR Home ID Reserver  Pool
----- ------    ----- ------ -------- -------    -------    -------  ---------  ---
1.0.0  aggr0_1  node1 node1  -        151759706  151759706  -       151759706 Pool0
1.0.1  aggr0_1  node1 node1           151759706  151759706  -       151759706 Pool0
.
.
.
----

. If the system is in a MetroCluster configuration, monitor the status of the controller: _metrocluster node show_
+
The MetroCluster configuration takes a few minutes after the replacement to return to a normal state, at which time each controller will show a configured state, with DR Mirroring enabled and a mode of normal. The `metrocluster node show -fields node-systemid` command output displays the old system ID until the MetroCluster configuration returns to a normal state.

. If the controller is in a MetroCluster configuration, depending on the MetroCluster state, verify that the DR home ID field shows the original owner of the disk if the original owner is a controller on the disaster site.
+
This is required if both of the following are true:

 ** The MetroCluster configuration is in a switchover state.
 ** The controller is the current owner of the disks on the disaster site.
+
See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/manage/concept_understanding_mcc_data_protection_and_disaster_recovery.html#disk-ownership-changes-during-ha-takeover-and-metrocluster-switchover-in-a-four-node-metrocluster-configuration[Disk ownership changes during HA takeover and MetroCluster switchover in a four-node MetroCluster configuration] for more information.

. If your system is in a MetroCluster configuration, verify that each controller is configured: _metrocluster node show - fields configuration-state_
+
----
node1_siteA::> metrocluster node show -fields configuration-state

dr-group-id            cluster node           configuration-state

. Verify that the expected volumes are present for each controller: 
+
`vol show -node node-name`
. If storage encryption is enabled, you must restore functionality.

. Return the impaired controller to normal operation by giving back its storage: 
+
`storage failover giveback -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`.

. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it:
+
`storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`.

. If AutoSupport is enabled, restore/unsuppress automatic case creation: 
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=END`.
