. Install the replacement boot media:
.. Remove the boot media from its package.
.. Slide the socket end of the boot media into its socket.
.. At the opposite end of the boot media, press down and hold the blue tab (in the open position), gently push down on that end of the boot media until it stops, and then release the tab to lock the boot media into place.

.About this task

The following illustration shows the operation of the controller handles (from the left side of a controller) when reinstalling the controller, and can be used as a reference for the rest of the controller reinstallation steps.

a|
Push the handles to reinsert the controller into the chassis halfway and then, when instructed, push until the controller is fully seated.

.Steps

. Close the controller cover and turn the thumbscrew clockwise until tightened.

. Insert the controller halfway into the chassis.
+
Align the rear of the controller with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller using the handles.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller in the chassis until instructed to do so later in this procedure.
+

. Reconnect the cables to the controller; however, do not plug in the power cord to the power supply (PSU) at this time.
+
NOTE: Make sure that the console cable is connected to the controller because you want to catch and log the boot sequence later in the boot media replacement procedure when you fully seat the controller in the chassis and it begins to boot.

+
. Fully seat the controller in the chassis:

.. Firmly push on the handles until the controller meets the midplane and is fully seated.
+
Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller into the chassis; it could damage the connectors.
+
NOTE: The controller boots when fully seated in the chassis. It gets its power from the partner controller.
+
.. If the controller boots to the LOADER prompt, reboot the controller: `boot_ontap`
.. Rotate the controller handles up and lock in place with the tabs.
+
. Reconnect the power cord to the PSU on the impaired controller.
+
Once power is restored to the PSU, the status LED should be green.
