To replace the boot media, you must remove the impaired controller, remove the impaired boot media, and install the replacement boot media in the impaired controller.

.About this task
If needed, you can turn on the storage system location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the affected storage system. Log into the BMC using SSH and enter the `system location-led _on_` command.

A storage system has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each controller. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. 

You can turn them off by entering the `system location-led _off_` command. If you are unsure if the LEDs are on or off, you can check their state by entering the `system location-led show` command.

== Step 1: Remove the controller

. Place the controller on an anti-static mat.

. Open the controller cover by turning the thumbscrew counterclockwise to loosen, and then open the cover.


== Step 2: Replace the boot media

To replace the boot media, locate it inside the controller and follow the specific sequence of steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself. 

. Remove the boot media:

. Install the replacement boot media:
.. Remove the boot media from its package.
.. Slide the socket end of the boot media into its socket.
.. At the opposite end of the boot media, press down and hold the blue tab (in the open position), gently push down on that end of the boot media until it touches the motherboard, and then release the tab to lock the boot media into place.

== Step 3: Reinstall the controller

Reinstall the controller into the chassis, but do not reboot it.

.About this task

The following illustration shows the operation of the controller handles (from the left side of a controller) when reinstalling the controller, and can be used as a reference for the rest of the controller reinstallation steps.

.Steps

. Close the controller cover and turn the thumbscrew clockwise until tightened.

. Insert the controller halfway into the chassis.
+
Align the rear of the controller with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller using the handles.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller in the chassis until instructed to do so later in this procedure.
+

. Reconnect the cables to the controller; however, do not plug in the power cord to the power supply (PSU) at this time.
+
NOTE: Make sure that the console cable is connected to the controller because you want to catch and log the boot sequence later in the boot media replacement procedure when you fully seat the controller in the chassis and it begins to boot.
