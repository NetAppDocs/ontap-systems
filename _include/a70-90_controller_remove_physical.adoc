// Remove the controller module - AFF A70 and AFF A90 (integrated)

You must remove the controller module from the chassis when you replace the controller module or replace a component inside the controller module.

. On the front of the chassis, use your thumbs to firmly push each drive in until you feel a positive stop. This ensures that the drives are firmly seated against the chassis midplane.

. Check the amber NVRAM that status LED located in slot 4/5 on the back of the impaired controller module is off. Look for the NV icon.

NOTE: If the NVRAM status LED is flashing, it could mean the controller module was not taken over or halted properly (uncommitted data). If the impaired controller module was not successfully taken over by the partner controller module, contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] before continuing with this procedure.

The general behavior of the NVRAM status LED on the impaired controller module is as follows: 

* The NVRAM status LED flashes when power is removed from the controller module and the storage system is in the "waiting for giveback" state, or the controller module is not taken over or halted properly (uncommitted data). 

* The NVRAM status LED flashes when the controller module is removed from the chassis and could mean the controller module is not taken over or halted properly (uncommitted data). Confirm that the controller module has been cleanly takeover by the partner controller module or the impaired controller module shows `waiting for giveback`. Then, the flashing LED can be ignored (and the controller module can be removed from the chassis).

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug the controller module power supply cables from the controller module power supplies (PSU).

+
NOTE: If your system has DC power, disconnect the power block from the PSUs. 
+

. Unplug the system cables and SFP and QSFP modules (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.

. Remove the cable management device from the controller module. 
. Press down on both of the locking latches, and then rotate both latches downward at the same time.
+
The controller module moves slightly out of the chassis.

. Slide the controller module out of the chassis and place it on a flat, stable surface.
+
Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the chassis.
