// Remove the controller module - AFF A70 and AFF A90 (integrated)

You must remove the controller module from the chassis when you replace the controller module or replace a component inside the controller module.

. On the front of the chassis, use your thumbs to firmly push each drive in until you feel a positive stop. This ensures that the drives are firmly seated against the chassis midplane.

. Press down on both of the locking latches, and then rotate both latches downward at the same time.
+
