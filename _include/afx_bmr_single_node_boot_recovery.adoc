.Before you begin

* For OKM, you need the cluster-wide passphrase and also the backup data.
* For EKM, you need copies of the following files from the partner node:
** /cfcard/kmip/servers.cfg file.
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.crt file. 
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.key file.
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/CA.pem file.


.Steps

. From the LOADER prompt, enter the command:
+
`boot_recovery -partner`
+
The screen displays the following message:
+
`Starting boot media recovery (BMR) process. Press Ctrl-C to abortâ€¦`

. Monitor the boot media install recovery process.
+
The process completes and displays the `Installation complete` message.  

. The system checks for encryption and encryption type and displays one of two messages. Depending on what message is displayed, take one of the following actions:
+

IMPORTANT: Occasionally, the process may not be able to identify if key manager is configured on the system. It will display an error message, ask if key manager is configured for the system, and then ask what type of key manager is configured. The process will resume after you resolve the issue.

Encryption is not installed on the system. Complete the following steps:

.. Press <enter> when console messages stop.
* If you see the login prompt, go to step 4.
* If you do not see login prompt, log into the partner node and proceed to step 4. 
.. Go to step 6 to enable automatic giveback if it was disabled.

Go to step 5 to restore the appropriate key manager.

The node accesses the boot menu and runs:

* Option 10 for systems with Onboard Key Manager (OKM).
* Option 11 for systems with External Key Manager (EKM).

. If encryption is not installed on the system and the login prompt is not displayed. Complete the following steps:
+
.. Give back only the root with override-destination-checks option:
+
`storage failover giveback -ofnode impaired-node -only-root true -override -destination-checks true`
+
If you encounter errors, contact https://support.netapp.com[NetApp Support].
+
.. Wait 5 minutes after the giveback report completes, and check failover status and giveback status:
+
`storage failover show and storage failover show-giveback`
+
.. If the HA internconnect links were taken down, bring them back up:
+
`system ha interconnect link on -node healthy-node -link 0`
+
`system ha interconnect link on -node healthy-node -link 1`
+
.. Return the impaired controller to normal operation by giving back its storage:
+
`storage failover giveback -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`

. Select the appropriate key manager restoration process.

.. Continue to monitor the recovery process as it restores the appropriate files from the partner node.
+
When the recovery process is complete, the node will reboot. The following messages indicate a successful recovery:
+

....
Trying to recover keymanager secrets.... 
Setting recovery material for the onboard key manager 
Recovery secrets set successfully
Trying to delete any existing km_onboard.keydb file.
 
Successfully recovered keymanager secrets.
....

.. When the node reboots, verify the boot media recovery was successful by confirming that the system is back online and operational.

.. Return the impaired controller to normal operation by giving back its storage:
+
`storage failover giveback -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`
+
... If the HA interconnect links were taken down, bring them back up to resume automatic giveback:
+
`system ha interconnect link on -node healthy-node -link 0`
+
`system ha interconnect link on -node healthy-node -link 1`

.. After the partner node is fully up and serving data, synchronize the OKM keys across the cluster.

.External Key Manager (EKM)

--
If EKM is detected, the system displays the following message and begins running BootMenu Option 11. 
....
key manager is configured.
Entering Bootmenu Option 11...
....

.. Depending on whether the key is successfully restored, take one of the following actions:

* If you see `kmip2_client: Successfully imported the keys from external key server: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5696` in the output, the EKM configuration has been successfully restored. 
+
The process attempts to restore the appropriate files from the partner node and reboots the node. Go to step d.

* If the key is not successfully restored, the system will halt and indicate that it could not restore the key. The error and warning messages are displayed. You must rerun the recovery process: 
+
`boot_recovery -partner`
