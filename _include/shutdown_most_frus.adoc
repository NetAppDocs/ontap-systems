To shut down the impaired controller, you must determine the status of the controller and, if necessary, take over the controller so that the healthy controller continues to serve data from the impaired controller storage.

.About this task
* If you have a SAN system, you must have checked event messages (`cluster kernel-service show`) for the impaired controller SCSI blade. The `cluster kernel-service show` command (from priv advanced mode) displays the node name, link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/display-nodes-cluster-task.html[quorum status]  of that node, availability status of that node, and operational status of that node.

+
Each SCSI-blade process should be in quorum with the other nodes in the cluster. Any issues must be resolved before you proceed with the replacement.

* If you have a cluster with more than two nodes, it must be in quorum. If the cluster is not in quorum or a healthy controller shows false for eligibility and health, you must correct the issue before shutting down the impaired controller; see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/synchronize-node-cluster-task.html?q=Quorum[Synchronize a node with the cluster^].

.Steps
. If AutoSupport is enabled, suppress automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message: 
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=<# of hours>h`
+
The following AutoSupport message suppresses automatic case creation for two hours:
+
`cluster1:> system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=2h`

. Disable automatic giveback:
.. Enter the following command from the console of the healthy controller: 
+
`storage failover modify -node _impaired_node_name_ -auto-giveback false`

.. Enter `y` when you see the prompt _Do you want to disable auto-giveback?_

+
. Take the impaired controller to the LOADER prompt:

Take over or halt the impaired controller from the healthy controller: 

`storage failover takeover -ofnode _impaired_node_name_ -halt _true_`

The _-halt true_ parameter brings you to the LOADER prompt.

//When the impaired controller shows Waiting for giveback..., press Ctrl-C, and then respond `y`.
