 
== Step 1: Check if your version of ONTAP supports NetApp Volume Encryption

Check whether your ONTAP version supports NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE). This information is crucial for downloading the correct ONTAP image.

.Steps

. Determine if your ONTAP version supports encryption by running the following command:
+
`version -v`
+
If the output includes `1Ono-DARE`, NVE is not supported on your cluster version.

. Depending on whether NVE is supported on your system, take one of the following actions:
* If NVE is supported, download the ONTAP image with NetApp Volume Encryption.
* If NVE is not supported, download the ONTAP image *without* NetApp Volume Encryption.

== Step 2: Determine if it is safe to shut down the controller
To safely shut down a controller, first identify whether the External Key Manager (EKM) or the Onboard Key Manager (OKM) is active. Then, verify the key manager in use, display the appropriate key information, and take action based on the status of the authentication keys.

.Steps

. Determine which key manager is enabled on your system:
+

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| ONTAP version| Run this command
a|
ONTAP 9.14.1 or later
a|

`security key-manager keystore show` 

* If EKM is enabled, `EKM` is listed in the command output.
* If OKM is enabled, `OKM` is listed in the command output.
* If no key manager is enabled, `No key manager keystores configured` is listed in the command output.

a|
ONTAP 9.13.1 or earlier
a|

`security key-manager show-key-store` 

* If EKM is enabled, `external` is listed in the command output.
* If OKM is enabled, `onboard` is listed in the command output.
* If no key manager is enabled, `No key managers configured` is listed in the command output.

.No key manager configured
--
You can safely shut down the impaired controller. Go to link:bootmedia-shutdown.html[shutdown the impaired controller].
--

.External or Onboard key manager configured
--
.. Enter the following query command to display the status of the authentication keys in your key manager.
+

`security key-manager key query`

.. Check the output for the value in the `Restored` column for your key manager. 
+

This column indicates whether the authentication keys for your key manager (either EKM or OKM) have been successfully restored.

Depending on the output value displayed in the `Restored` column, follow the appropriate steps.

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]

a|
`true`
a|
You can safely shut down the impaired controller. Go to link:bootmedia-shutdown.html[shutdown the impaired controller].
a|
Anything other than `true`
a|
.. Restore the external key management authentication keys to all nodes in the cluster using the following command:
+
`security key-manager external restore`
+
If the command fails, contact http://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support^].
+
.. Verify that the `Restored` column displays `true` for all authentication keys by entering the  `security key-manager key query` command.
+
If all the authentication keys are `true`, you can safely shut down the impaired controller. Go to link:bootmedia-shutdown.html[shutdown the impaired controller].

Manually back up the OKM information.

.. Go to the advanced mode by entering `set -priv advanced` and then enter `Y` when prompted.
.. Enter the following command to display the key management information: 
+
`security key-manager onboard show-backup`

 .. Copy the contents of the backup information to a separate file or your log file. 

+
You'll need it in disaster scenarios where you might need to manually recover OKM.

 .. You can safely shut down the impaired controller. Go to link:bootmedia-shutdown.html[shutdown the impaired controller].


a|
Anything other than `true`
a|

.. Enter the onboard security key-manager sync command:
+
`security key-manager onboard sync`
+
.. Enter the 32 character, alphanumeric onboard key management passphrase when prompted. 
+
If the passphrase cannot be provided, contact http://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support^].

.. Verify the `Restored` column displays `true` for all authentication keys: 
+
`security key-manager key query`

.. Verify that the `Key Manager` type displays `onboard`, and then manually back up the OKM information.

.. Enter the command to display the key management backup information:
+
`security key-manager onboard show-backup`

.. Copy the contents of the backup information to a separate file or your log file. 
+
You'll need it in disaster scenarios where you might need to manually recover OKM.
