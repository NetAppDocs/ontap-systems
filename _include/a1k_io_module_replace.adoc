Use this procedure to replace a failed I/O module.

* You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your storage system.
* All other components in the storage system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired node

Shut down or take over the impaired controller using one of the following options.

== Step 2: Replace a failed I/O module

To replace an I/O module, locate it within the enclosure and follow the specific sequence of steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug the PSUs cables from the PSUs from the controller.

+
NOTE: If your storage system has DC power supplies, disconnect the power cable block from the PSU.
+

. Unplug any cabling on the target I/O module.
. Rotate the cable management arm down by pulling the buttons on both sides on the inside of the cable management arm and then rotate the arm down.

Make sure that you label the cables so that you know where they came from.

. Remove the target I/O module from the enclosure:
.. Depress the cam button on the target module.
+
The cam button moves away from the enclosure.

.. Rotate the cam latch down as far as it will go. For horizontal modules, rotate the cam away from the module as far as it will go.
.. Remove the module from the enclosure by hooking your finger into the cam lever opening and pulling the module out of the enclosure.
+
Make sure that you keep track of which slot the I/O module was in.

. Set the I/O module aside.
. Install the replacement I/O module into the enclosure:
.. Align the module with the edges of the enclosure slot opening.
.. Gently slide the module into the slot all the way into the enclosure, and then rotate the cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. Cable the I/O module.
. Reconnect the PSUs.
. Rotate the cable management arm up to the closed position.

== Step 3: Reboot the controller

After you replace an I/O module, you must reboot the controller module.

NOTE: If the new I/O module is not the same model as the failed module, you must first reboot the BMC.

.Steps
. Reboot the BMC if the replacement module is not the same model as the old module:
.. From the LOADER prompt, change to advanced privilege mode: `set privilege advanced`
.. Reboot the BMC: `sp reboot`
. From the LOADER prompt, reboot the node: `bye`
+
NOTE: This reinitializes the I/O cards and other components and reboots the node.
+
. Return the node to normal operation: `storage failover giveback -ofnode impaired_node_name`

. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`

== Step 4: Return the failed part to NetApp
