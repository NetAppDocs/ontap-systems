To replace an I/O module, you must perform a specific sequence of tasks.

* You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your system.
* All other components in the system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired node

Shut down or take over the impaired controller using one of the following options.

== Step 2: Replace I/O modules

To replace an I/O module, locate it within the chassis and follow the specific sequence of steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug any cabling associated with the target I/O module.
+
Make sure that you label the cables so that you know where they came from.

. Remove the target I/O module from the chassis:
.. Depress the lettered and numbered cam button.
+
The cam button moves away from the chassis.

.. Rotate the cam latch down until it is in a horizontal position.
+
The I/O module disengages from the chassis and moves about 1/2 inch out of the I/O slot.

.. Remove the I/O module from the chassis by pulling on the pull tabs on the sides of the module face.
+
Make sure that you keep track of which slot the I/O module was in.

. Set the I/O module aside.
. Install the replacement I/O module into the chassis by gently sliding the I/O module into the slot until the lettered and numbered I/O cam latch begins to engage with the I/O cam pin, and then push the I/O cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. Recable the I/O module, as needed.

== Step 3: Reboot the controller

After you replace an I/O module, you must reboot the controller module.

NOTE: If the new I/O module is not the same model as the failed module, you must first reboot the BMC.

.Steps
. Reboot the BMC if the replacement module is not the same model as the old module:
.. From the LOADER prompt, change to advanced privilege mode: `priv set advanced`
.. Reboot the BMC: `sp reboot`
. From the LOADER prompt, reboot the node: `bye`
+
NOTE: This reinitializes the PCIe cards and other components and reboots the node.

. If your system is configured to support 10 GbE cluster interconnect and data connections on 40 GbE NICs, convert these ports to 10 GbE connections by using the nicadmin convert command from Maintenance mode. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/convert_40gbe_nic_ports_into_multiple_10gbe_ports_for_10gbe_connectivity.html[Convert 40GbE NIC ports into multiple 10GbE ports for 10GbE connectivity^] for more information.
+
NOTE: Be sure to exit Maintenance mode after completing the conversion.

. Return the node to normal operation: `storage failover giveback -ofnode impaired_node_name`

. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`

== Step 4: Return the failed part to NetApp
