// Install the controller module - A1K (modular)

Reinstall the controller module and boot it.

. Ensure the air duct is completely closed by rotating it down as far as it will go.
+
It must lie flush against the controller module sheet metal.

. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the enclosure, and slide the controller module into the chassis with the levers rotated away from the front of the system.

. Once the controller module stops you from sliding it farther, rotate the cam handles inward until they latch back under the fans

+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the enclosure to avoid damaging the connectors.
+
The controller module begins to boot as soon as it is fully seated in the enclosure.

. Align the bezel with the ball studs and then gently push the bezel into place.

+
`storage failover giveback -ofnode impaired-node -only-root true -override -destination-checks true`

. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it:
