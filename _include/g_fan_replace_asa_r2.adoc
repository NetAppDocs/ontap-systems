To replace a fan, you must remove the controller, remove the faulty fan, install the replacement fan, and then reinstall the controller.

.About this task
If needed, you can turn on the storage system location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the affected storage system. Log into the BMC using SSH and enter the `system location-led _on_` command.

A storage system has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each controller. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. 

You can turn them off by entering the `system location-led _off_` command. If you are unsure if the LEDs are on or off, you can check their state by entering the `system location-led show` command.
