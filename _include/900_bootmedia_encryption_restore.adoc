After environment variables are checked, you must complete steps specific to restore  Onboard Key Manager (OKM), NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) and NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE).

Determine which section you should use to restore your OKM, NSE, or NVE configurations: If NSE or NVE are enabled along with Onboard Key Manager you must restore settings you captured at the beginning of this procedure.

 * If NSE or NVE are enabled and Onboard Key Manager is enabled, go to <<Restore NVE or NSE when Onboard Key Manager is enabled>>.
  * If NSE or NVE are enabled for ONTAP 9.6, go to <<Restore NSE/NVE on systems running ONTAP 9.6 and later>>.

== Restore NVE or NSE when Onboard Key Manager is enabled

.Steps
. Connect the console cable to the target controller.
. Use the boot_ontap command at the LOADER prompt to boot the controller.
. Check the console output:

| If the console displays...| Then...
a|
The LOADER prompt
a|
Boot the controller to the boot menu: `boot_ontap menu`
a|
Waiting for giveback....
a|

 .. Enter `Ctrl-C` at the prompt
 .. At the message: Do you wish to halt this node rather than wait [y/n]? , enter: `y`
 .. At the LOADER prompt, enter the `boot_ontap menu` command.

+
|===

. At the Boot Menu, enter the hidden command, `recover_onboard_keymanager`, and reply `y` at the prompt.
. Enter the passphrase for the onboard key manager you obtained from the customer at the beginning of this procedure.
. When prompted to enter the backup data, paste the backup data you captured at the beginning of this section, when asked. Paste the output of `security key-manager backup show` OR `security key-manager onboard show-backup` command.
+
NOTE: The data is output from either `security key-manager backup show` or security key-manager onboard show-backup` command.

. At the Boot Menu select the option for Normal Boot.
+
The system boots to Waiting for giveback... prompt.

. Move the console cable to the partner controller and log in as admin.
. Confirm the target controller is ready for giveback with the `storage failover show` command.
. Give back only the CFO aggregates with the `storage failover giveback -fromnode local -only-cfo-aggregates true` command.
 ** If the command fails because of a failed disk, physically disengage the failed disk, but leave the disk in the slot until a replacement is received.
 ** If the command fails because of an open CIFS session, check with the customer how to close out CIFS sessions.
+
NOTE: Terminating CIFS can cause loss of data.

 ** If the command fails because the partner "not ready", wait 5 minutes for the NVRAMs to synchronize.
 ** If the command fails because of an NDMP, SnapMirror, or SnapVault process, disable the process. See the appropriate content for more information.
. Once the giveback completes, check the failover and giveback status with the `storage failover show` and `storage failover show-giveback` commands.
+
Only the CFO aggregates (root aggregate and CFO style data aggregates) will be shown.

. If you are running ONTAP 9.6 or later, run the security key-manager onboard sync:
 .. Run the `security key-manager onboard sync` command and then enter the passphrase when prompted.
 .. Enter the `security key-manager key-query` command to see a detailed view of all keys stored in the onboard key manager and verify that the `Restored` column = `yes/true` for all authentication keys.
+
NOTE: If the `Restored` column = anything other than `yes/true`, contact Customer Support.

 .. Wait 10 minutes for the key to synchronize across the cluster.
. Move the console cable to the partner controller.
. Give back the target controller using the `storage failover giveback -fromnode local` command.
. Check the giveback status, three minutes after it reports complete, using the `storage failover show` command.
+
If giveback is not complete after 20 minutes, contact Customer Support.

. At the clustershell prompt, enter the net int show -is-home false command to list the logical interfaces that are not on their home controller and port.
+
If any interfaces are listed as `false`, revert those interfaces back to their home port using the `net int revert -vserver Cluster -lif _nodename_` command.

. Move the console cable to the target controller and run the `version -v` command to check the ONTAP versions.
. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.

|===

. Move the console cable to the partner controller and give back the target controller storage using the storage failover giveback -fromnode local -only-cfo-aggregates true local command.
 ** If the command fails because of a failed disk, physically disengage the failed disk, but leave the disk in the slot until a replacement is received.
 ** If the command fails because of an open CIFS sessions, check with customer how to close out CIFS sessions.
+
NOTE: Terminating CIFS can cause loss of data.

 ** If the command fails because the partner is "not ready", wait 5 minutes for the NVMEMs to synchronize.
 ** If the command fails because of an NDMP, SnapMirror, or SnapVault process, disable the process. See the appropriate content for more information.

. Wait 3 minutes and check the failover status with the storage failover show command.
. At the clustershell prompt, enter the `net int show -is-home false` command to list the logical interfaces that are not on their home controller and port.
+
If any interfaces are listed as `false`, revert those interfaces back to their home port using the `net int revert -vserver Cluster -lif _nodename_` command.

. Move the console cable to the target controller and run the `version -v` command to check the ONTAP versions.
. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.
. Use the `storage encryption disk show` at the clustershell prompt, to review the output.
. Use the `security key-manager key-query` command to display the encryption and  authentication keys that are stored on the key management servers.
 ** If the `Restored` column = `yes/true`, you are done and can proceed to complete the replacement process.
 ** If the `Key Manager type` = `external` and the `Restored` column = anything other than `yes/true`, use the `security key-manager external restore` command to restore the key IDs of the authentication keys.
+
NOTE: If the command fails, contact Customer Support.

 ** If the `Key Manager type` = `onboard` and the `Restored` column = anything other than `yes/true`, use the `security key-manager onboard sync` command to re-sync the Key Manager type.
+
Use the `security key-manager key-query` command to verify that the `Restored` column = `yes/true` for all authentication keys.
. Connect the console cable to the partner controller.
. Give back the controller using the storage failover giveback -fromnode local command.
. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.
