// New include specific to g-platform family because the requirements reference 9.17.1 and slot 4, which are unique to g-platforms.

To use this procedure, make sure your storage system meets all requirements.

NOTE: If your storage system does not meet all requirements, you must use the link:io-module-replace.html[replace an I/O module procedure].

* Your storage system must be running ONTAP 9.17.1 or later.
* The I/O module that failed must be a cluster and HA I/O module in slot 4 and you must be replacing it with an equivalent cluster and HA I/O module. You cannot change the I/O module type.
* Your storage system configuration must have only one cluster and HA I/O module located in slot 4, not two cluster and HA I/O modules.
* Your storage system must be a two-node (switchless or switched) cluster configuration.
* The controller with the failed cluster and HA I/O module (the impaired controller) must have already taken over the healthy partner controller. The takeover should have occurred automatically if the I/O module is failed.
+
For two-node clusters, the storage system cannot discern which controller has the failed I/O module, so either controller might initiate the takeover. The cluster and HA I/O module hot-swap procedure is only supported when the controller with the failed I/O module (the impaired controller) has taken over the healthy controller.
+
You can verify that the impaired controller successfully took over the healthy controller by entering the `storage failover show` command.
+
If you are not sure which controller has the failed I/O module, contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support].  

* All other components in the storage system must be functioning properly; if not, contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] before continuing with this procedure.
