.Steps

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.

. Locate the DIMMs on your controller and identify the faulty DIMM.

+
NOTE: Consult either the https://hwu.netapp.com[Netapp Hardware Universe] or the FRU map on the cover of the controller for exact DIMM locations. 
+
. Remove the faulty DIMM:

* Note the orientation of the DIMM in the socket so that you can insert the replacement DIMM using the same orientation.
* Eject the faulty DIMM by slowly pushing apart the two DIMM ejector tabs on both ends of the DIMM slot.

IMPORTANT: Carefully hold the DIMM by the corners or edges to avoid pressure on the DIMM circuit board components.

Lift the DIMM up and out of the slot.

The ejector tabs remain in the open position.

. Install the replacement DIMM:

.. Remove the replacement DIMM from its antistatic shipping bag.

.. Make sure that the DIMM ejector tabs on the connector are in the open position.

.. Hold the DIMM by the corners, and then insert the DIMM squarely into the slot.
+
The notch on the bottom of the DIMM, among the pins, should line up with the tab in the slot.
+
When inserted correctly, the DIMM goes in easily but fits tightly in the slot. Reinsert the DIMM if you feel it is not inserted correctly.

.. Visually check the DIMM to make sure it is evenly aligned and fully inserted into the slot.

.. Push down carefully, but firmly, on the top edge of the DIMM until the ejector tabs snap into place over the notches at both ends of the DIMM.
