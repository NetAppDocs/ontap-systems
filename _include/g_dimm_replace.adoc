You must replace a DIMM in the controller when your storage system encounters errors such as, excessive CECC (Correctable Error Correction Codes) errors that are based on Health Monitor alerts or uncorrectable ECC errors, typically caused by a single DIMM failure preventing the storage system from booting ONTAP. 

.Before you begin

* All other components in the storage system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] before continuing with this procedure.

* You must replace the failed FRU component with a replacement FRU component you received from your provider.

.About this task
If needed, you can turn on the storage system location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the affected storage system. Log into the BMC using SSH and enter the `system location-led _on_` command.

A storage system has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each controller. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. 

You can turn them off by entering the `system location-led _off_` command. If you are unsure if the LEDs are on or off, you can check their state by entering the `system location-led show` command.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller
 
// Shut down or take over the impaired controller using one of the following options.
 
// [role="tabbed-block"]
// ====
 
// .Option 1: Most systems

// .Option 2: Controller is in a MetroCluster

== Step 2: Remove the controller

. Open the controller cover by turning the thumbscrew counterclockwise to loosen, and then open the cover. 

== Step 3: Replace a DIMM

To replace a DIMM, locate the faulty DIMM inside the controller and follow the specific sequence of steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.

. Locate the DIMMs on your controller and identify the faulty DIMM.

+
NOTE: Consult either the https://hwu.netapp.com[Netapp Hardware Universe] or the FRU map on the cover of the controller for exact DIMM locations.

. Remove the faulty DIMM:

DIMM slot numbering and positions.

NOTE: Depending on your storage system model you will have two or four DIMMs.

* Note the orientation of the DIMM in the socket so that you can insert the replacement DIMM using the same orientation.
* Eject the faulty DIMM by slowly pushing apart the two DIMM ejector tabs on both ends of the DIMM slot.

IMPORTANT: Carefully hold the DIMM by the corners or edges to avoid pressure on the DIMM circuit board components.

Lift the DIMM up and out of the slot.

The ejector tabs remain in the open position.

. Install the replacement DIMM:

.. Remove the replacement DIMM from its antistatic shipping bag.

.. Make sure that the DIMM ejector tabs on the connector are in the open position.

.. Hold the DIMM by the corners, and then insert the DIMM squarely into the slot.
+
The notch on the bottom of the DIMM, among the pins, should line up with the tab in the slot.
+
When inserted correctly, the DIMM should go in easily but fit tightly in the slot. If not, reinsert the DIMM.

.. Visually inspect the DIMM to verify that it is evenly aligned and fully inserted into the slot.

.. Push down carefully, but firmly, on the top edge of the DIMM until the ejector tabs snap into place over the notches at both ends of the DIMM.


== Step 4: Reinstall the controller

Reinstall the controller into the chassis and reboot it.

== Step 5: Return the failed part to NetApp
