.Before you begin
All other components in the storage system must be functioning properly; if not, contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] before continuing with this procedure.

.About this task
* You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your storage system.
* If needed, you can turn on the storage system location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the affected storage system. Log into the BMC using SSH and enter the `system location-led _on_` command.
+
A storage system has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each controller. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. 
+
You can turn them off by entering the `system location-led _off_` command. If you are unsure if the LEDs are on or off, you can check their state by entering the `system location-led show` command.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller

Shut down or take over the impaired controller using one of the following options.

.Option 1: Most systems

.Option 2: Controller is in a MetroCluster

== Step 2: Remove the controller

include::../_include/g_controller_remove.adoc[]

. Open the controller cover by turning the thumbscrew counterclockwise to loosen, and then open the cover.
 
== Step 3: Replace the RTC battery

Remove the failed RTC battery and install the replacement RTC battery.

. Locate the RTC battery.

Lift the RTC battery out of its holder.

. Install the replacement RTC battery:

.. Remove the replacement battery from the antistatic shipping bag.

.. Position the battery so that the plus sign on the battery faces out to correspond with the plus sign on the motherboard.

.. Insert the battery into the holder at an angle, and then push it into an upright position so it is fully seated in the holder.

.. Visually inspect the battery to make sure that it is completely seated in its holder and that the polarity is correct.

== Step 4: Reinstall the controller

Reinstall the controller into the chassis and reboot it.

include::../_include/g_controller_reinstall.adoc[]

== Step 5: Reset the time and date on the controller

NOTE: After replacing the RTC battery, inserting the controller and powering on first BIOS reset, you will see the following error messages: 
`RTC date/time error. Reset date/time to default`
`RTC power failure error`
These messages are expected and you can continue with this procedure.

. On the healthy controller, check the date and time with the `cluster date show` command.
+
NOTE: If your storage system stops at the boot menu, select the option for  `Reboot node` and respond _y_ when prompted, then boot to LOADER by pressing _Ctrl-C_.
+
. On the impaired controller, at the LOADER prompt, check the time and date: `cluster date show`

.. If necessary, modify the date: `set date _mm/dd/yyyy_`

.. If necessary, set the time, in GMT: `set time hh:mm:ss`

.. Confirm the date and time.
. At the LOADER prompt, enter `bye` to reinitialize the I/O modules, other components, and let the controller reboot.
. Return the controller to normal operation by giving back its storage: `storage failover giveback -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`
. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback _true_`

== Step 6: Return the failed part to NetApp
