You can hot-add up to two NS224 shelves to an AFF A20, AFF A30, AFF C30, AFF A50, or AFF C60 HA pair when additional storage (to the internal shelf) is needed.

.Before you begin

* You must have reviewed the link:requirements-hot-add-shelf.html[hot-add requirements and best practices]. 

* You must have completed the applicable procedures in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Prepare-to hot-add a shelf]. 

* You must have installed the shelves, powered them on, and set the shelf IDs as described in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Install a shelf for a hot-add].


.About this task

* This procedure assumes that your HA pair has only internal storage (no external shelves) and that you are hot-adding up to two additional shelves and two RoCE-capable I/O modules in each controller.

* This procedure addresses the following hot-add scenarios:
** Hot-adding the first shelf to an HA pair with one RoCE-capable I/O module in each controller.
** Hot-adding the first shelf to an HA pair with two RoCE-capable I/O modules in each controller.
** Hot- adding the second shelf to an HA pair with two RoCE-capable I/O modules in each controller.

.Steps

. If you are hot-adding one shelf using one set of RoCE-capable ports (one RoCE-capable I/O module) in each controller module, and this is the only NS224 shelf in your HA pair, complete the following substeps.
+
Otherwise, go to the next step.
+
NOTE: This step assumes you installed the RoCE-capable I/O module in slot 3.
+
.. Cable shelf NSM A port eXa to controller A slot 3 port a (e3a).
.. Cable shelf NSM A port eXb to controller B slot 3 port b (e3b).
.. Cable shelf NSM B port eXa to controller B slot 3 port a (e3a).
.. Cable shelf NSM B port eXb to controller A slot 3 port b (e3b).
+
The following illustration shows cabling for one hot-added shelf using one RoCE-capable I/O module in each controller module:

. If you are hot-adding one or two shelves using two sets of RoCE-capable ports (two RoCE-capable I/O modules) in each controller module, complete the applicable substeps.
+
NOTE: This step assumes you installed the RoCE-capable I/O modules in slots 3 and 1.

.. Cable NSM B port eXb to controller A slot 1 port b (e1b).
.. If you are hot-adding a second shelf, complete the "`Shelf 2`" substeps; otherwise, go to step 3.

. Verify that the hot-added shelf is cabled correctly using https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[Active IQ Config Advisor^].
+
If any cabling errors are generated, follow the corrective actions provided.

.What's next?
If you disabled automatic drive assignment as part of the preparation for this procedure, you need to manually assign drive ownership and then reenable automatic drive assignment, if needed. Go to link:complete-hot-add-shelf.html[Complete the hot-add].

Otherwise, you are done with the hot-add shelf procedure.
