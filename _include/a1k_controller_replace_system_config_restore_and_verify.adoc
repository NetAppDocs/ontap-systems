== Step 1: Verify HA config settings

You must verify the `HA` state of the controller module and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

.Steps
. Boot to maintenance mode: `boot_ontap maint` 

.. Enter `y` when you see _Continue with boot?_.
+
If you see the _System ID mismatch_ warning message, enter `y`.

. Enter `sysconfig -v` and capture the display contents.

+
NOTE: If you see _PERSONALITY MISMATCH_ contact customer support.

. From the `sysconfig -v` output, compare the adapter card information with the cards and locations in the replacement controller.

. Verify that all components display the same `HA` state: `ha-config show`
+
The HA state should be the same for all components.

. If the displayed system state of the controller module does not match your system configuration, set the `HA` state for the controller module: `ha-config modify controller ha`

+
The value for the HA state can be one of the following:

*** `ha`
*** `mcc` (not supported)
*** `mccip` (not supported in ASA systems)
*** `non-ha` (not supported)

. Confirm that the setting has changed: `ha-config show`

== Step 2: Verify disk list

.Steps
. Verify that the adapter lists the paths to all disks with the `storage show disk -p`.
+
If you see any issues, check cabling and reseat cables.

. Exit Maintenance mode: `halt`.
