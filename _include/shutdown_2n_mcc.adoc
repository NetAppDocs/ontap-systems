To shut down the impaired controller, you must determine the status of the controller and, if necessary, switch over the controller so that the healthy controller continues to serve data from the impaired controller storage.

.About this task

* You must leave the power supplies turned on at the end of this procedure to provide power to the healthy controller.

.Steps
. Check the MetroCluster status to determine whether the impaired controller has automatically switched over to the healthy controller: `metrocluster show`
. Depending on whether an automatic switchover has occurred, proceed according to the following table:
+
[options="header" cols="1,2"]
|===
| If the impaired controller...| Then...
a|
Has automatically switched over
a|
Proceed to the next step.
a|
Has not automatically switched over
a|
Perform a planned switchover operation from the healthy controller: `metrocluster switchover`
a|
Has not automatically switched over, you attempted switchover with the `metrocluster switchover` command, and the switchover was vetoed
a|
Review the veto messages and, if possible, resolve the issue and try again. If you are unable to resolve the issue, contact technical support.

. Resynchronize the data aggregates by running the `metrocluster heal -phase aggregates` command from the surviving cluster.

controller_A_1::> metrocluster heal -phase aggregates

If the healing is vetoed, you have the option of reissuing the `metrocluster heal` command with the `-override-vetoes` parameter. If you use this optional parameter, the system overrides any soft vetoes that prevent the healing operation.

. Verify that the operation has been completed by using the metrocluster operation show command.
