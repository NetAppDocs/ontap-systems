Restore the ONTAP image from the partner node when the boot media is corrupted.

.About this task
If a node's boot media is corrupted, the boot process will halt at the LOADER prompt and display boot error messages.

When you encounter these boot error messages, you need to restore the ONTAP image from the partner node.

.Steps

. From the LOADER prompt, enter the command:
+
`boot_recovery -partner`
+
The screen displays the following message:
+
`Starting boot media recovery (BMR) process. Press Ctrl-C to abort…`

+

. Monitor the boot media recovery process as LOADER configures the local cluster ports and executes `netboot` from the partner node.
+
When netboot is running, the `Starting BMR` message displays.
+

. Depending on the encryption method, select the option that matches your single-node configuration:
+
// start tabbed area

.No Encryption 
--
If no encryption is detected, the boot media recovery process continues without requiring key management.

Continue to monitor the recovery process as it restores the backup config, env file, mdb, and rdb from the partner node.

When the recovery process is complete, the node will reboot. The following messages indicate a successful recovery:

....

varfs_backup_restore: update checksum for varfs.tgz
varfs_backup_restore: restore using /cfcard/x86_64/freebsd/oldvarfs.tgz
varfs_backup_restore: attempting to restore /var/kmip to the boot device
varfs_backup_restore: failed to restore /var/kmip to the boot device
varfs_backup_restore: Rebooting to load the new varfs
.
Terminated
varfs_backup_restore: bootarg.abandon_varfs is set! Skipping /var backup.

.External Key Manager (EKM)
--

If EKM is configured, the system displays the following prompt.

....
Error when fetching key manager config from partner <IP>: 28

Has key manager been configured on this system? {y|n}
....

.. Enter `Y` if EKM has been configured.
+
....
key manager is configured.
Entering Bootmenu Option 11...
....

+
You'll be prompted for the EKM settings that were initially used during setup.

.. Enter each EKM configuration setting when prompted. 
+

.. Verify that the attributes for the Cluster UUID and the Keystore UUID are correct. 
* On the partner node, retrieve the Cluster UUID using the following command.
+
`cluster identity show`
+

* On the partner node, retrieve the Keystore UUID using the following commands.
+
`vserver show -type admin`
+
`key-manager keystore show -vserver <nodename>`
+

* If the partner node is unavailable, use the Mroot-AK key to retrieve the UUID:
+
** For the Cluster UUID, enter the following command: 
+
`x-NETAPP-ClusterName: <cluster name>` 
+
** For the Keystore UUID, enter the following command:
+
`x-NETAPP-KeyUsage: MROOT-AK` 

.. Enter the values for Keystore UUID and Cluster UUID when prompted.
+


.. Depending on whether the key is successfully restored, take one of the following actions:
+
* If the key is successfully restored, the recovery process continues and reboots the node. Proceed to step 4.
+
* If the key is not successfully restored, the system will halt and display error and warning messages. Rerun the recovery process.
