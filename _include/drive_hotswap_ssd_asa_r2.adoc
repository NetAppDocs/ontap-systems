.Steps

. Properly ground yourself.
. Physically identify the failed drive.
+
When a drive fails, the system logs a warning message to the system console indicating which drive failed. Additionally, the attention (amber) LED on the drive shelf operator display panel and the failed drive illuminate.
+
NOTE: The activity (green) LED on a failed drive can be illuminated (solid), which indicates that the drive has power, but should not be blinking, which indicates I/O activity. A failed drive has no I/O activity.

. Remove the failed drive:
 .. Press the release button on the drive face to open the cam handle.
 .. Slide the drive out of the shelf using the cam handle and supporting the drive with your other hand.
. Wait a minimum of 70 seconds before inserting the replacement drive.
+
This allows the system to recognize that a drive was removed.

. Insert the replacement drive:
 .. With the cam handle in the open position, use both hands to insert the replacement drive.
 .. Push until the drive stops.
 .. Close the cam handle so that the drive is fully seated into the midplane and the handle clicks into place.
+
Be sure to close the cam handle slowly so that it aligns correctly with the face of the drive.
. Verify that the drive's activity (green) LED is illuminated.
+
When the drive's activity LED is solid, it means that the drive has power. When the drive's activity LED is blinking, it means that the drive has power and I/O is in progress. If the drive firmware is automatically updating, the LED blinks.

. If you are replacing another drive, repeat Steps 2 through 6.

. Return the failed part to NetApp, as described in the RMA instructions shipped with the kit.
