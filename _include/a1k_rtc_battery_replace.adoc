.Before you begin
* Understand that you can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your system.
* Make sure all other components in the system are functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

You must use an approved RTC battery.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller

Shut down or take over the impaired controller using one of the following options.

====

.Option 1: Most systems

--
.Option 2: Controller is in a MetroCluster
--
include::../_include/shutdown_any_mcc_no_2-node_mcc.adoc[]

== Step 2: Remove the controller module

include::../_include/a1k_controller_remove_physical.adoc[]
 
== Step 3: Replace the RTC battery

Remove failed RTC battery and install the replacement RTC battery.

.Steps

. Open the controller air duct on the top of the controller.
.. Insert your fingers in the recesses at the far ends of the air duct.
.. Lift the air duct and rotate it upward as far as it will go.
. Locate the RTC battery under the air duct.

. Gently push the battery away from the holder, rotate it away from the holder, and then lift it out of the holder.
+
NOTE: Note the polarity of the battery as you remove it from the holder. The battery is marked with a plus sign and must be positioned in the holder correctly. A plus sign near the holder tells you how the battery should be positioned.

. Remove the replacement battery from the antistatic shipping bag.
. Note the polarity of the RTC battery, and then insert it into the holder by tilting the battery at an angle and pushing down.
. Visually inspect the battery to make sure that it is completely installed into the holder and that the polarity is correct.

== Step 4: Reinstall the controller module


include::../_include/a1k_controller_install_step_physical.adoc[]

== Step 5: Reset the time and date on the controller

NOTE: After replacing the RTC battery, inserting controller and powering on first BIOS reset, you will see the following error messages: 
`RTC date/time error. Reset date/time to default`
`RTC power failure error`
These messages are excpected and you can continue with this procedure.

.Steps

 . Check the date and time on the healthy controller with the _cluster date show_ command.

NOTE: If your system stops at the boot menu, select the option for  `Reboot node` and respond _y_ when prompted, then boot to LOADER by pressing _Ctrl-C_

 .. At the LOADER prompt on the target controller, check the time and date with the `cluster date show` command.
 .. If necessary, modify the date with the `set date mm/dd/yyyy` command.
 .. If necessary, set the time, in GMT, using the `set time hh:mm:ss` command.
 . Confirm the date and time on the target controller.
. At the LOADER prompt, enter _bye_ to reinitialize the PCIe cards and other components and let the controller reboot.

== Step 6: Return the failed part to NetApp
