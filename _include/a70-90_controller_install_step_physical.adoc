// Install the controller module - AFF A70 and AFF A90 (integrated)

Install the controller module

After you replace a FRU in the controller module, reinstall the controller module and reboot it.

. If you have not already done so, close the air duct by rotating it down as far as it will go.
+
It should lie flush against the controller module sheet metal.
+
. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Recable the system, as needed.
+
If you removed the media converters (QSFPs or SFPs), remember to reinstall them if you are using fiber optic cables.

. Complete the reinstallation of the controller module:
 .. Firmly push the controller module into the chassis until it meets the midplane and is fully seated.
+
The locking latches rise when the controller module is fully seated.


NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.

NOTE: If you have DC power supplies, reconnect the power block to the power supplies after the controller module is fully seated in the chassis.


The controller module begins to boot as soon as it is fully seated in the chassis.

 .. Rotate the locking latches upward, tilting them so that they clear the locking pins, and then lower them into the locked position.
 .. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
