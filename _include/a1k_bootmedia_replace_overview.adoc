The boot media stores a primary and secondary set of system (boot image) files that the system uses when it boots. Depending on your network configuration, you can perform either a nondisruptive or disruptive replacement.

You must have a USB flash drive, formatted to FAT32, with the appropriate amount of storage to hold the `image_xxx.tgz`.

You also must copy the `image_xxx.tgz` file to the USB flash drive for later use in this procedure.

* The nondisruptive and disruptive methods for replacing a boot media both require you to restore the `var` file system:
 ** For nondisruptive replacement, the HA pair does not require connection to a network to restore the `var` file system. The HA pair in a single chassis has an  internal e0S connection,  which is used to transfer `var` config between them.

 ** For disruptive replacement, you do not need a network connection to restore the `var` file system, but the process requires two reboots.
* You must replace the failed component with a replacement FRU component you received from your provider.
* It is important that you apply the commands in these steps on the correct controller:
 ** The _impaired_ controller is the controller on which you are performing maintenance.
 ** The _healthy_ controller is the HA partner of the impaired controller.
