// New include specific to g-platform family because the steps for bringing the replacement cluster/HA I/O module online specify/reference slot 4, which is unique to g-platforms.


Bring the replacement cluster and HA I/O module in slot 4 online and then verify it is online and recognized.

. Bring the replacement cluster and HA I/O module online:
+
`system controller slot module insert -node impaired_node_name_ -slot _slot_name_`
+
NOTE: When you see _Do you want to continue?_, enter `y`. 
+
The output should confirm the cluster and HA I/O module was successfully brought online (powered on, initialized, and placed into service).
+
For example, the following command brings slot 4 on node1 (the impaired controller) online, and displays a message that the process was successful:
+
----
node1::> system controller slot module insert -node node1 -slot 4

Warning: IO_2X_100GBE_NVDA_NIC module in slot 4 of node node1 will be powered on and initialized.

Do you want to continue? {y|n}: `y`

The module has been successfully powered on, initialized and placed into service.
----

. Verify that each port on the cluster and HA I/O module successfully initiated:
+
`event log show -event \*hotplug.init*`
+
NOTE: It might take several minutes to allow for any required firmware updates and port initialization.
+
The output should show a hotplug.init.success EMS event logged for each port on the cluster and HA I/O module with `_hotplug.init.success:_` in the `_Event_` column.
+
For example, the following output shows initialization succeded for cluster and HA I/O module ports e4b and e4a:
+
----
node1::> event log show -event *hotplug.init*                        

Time                Node             Severity      Event

------------------- ---------------- ------------- ---------------------------

7/11/2025 16:04:06  node1       NOTICE        hotplug.init.success: Initialization of ports "e4b" in slot 4 succee

7/11/2025 16:04:06  node1      NOTICE        hotplug.init.success: Initialization of ports "e4a" in slot 4 succee

2 entries were displayed.

. Verify I/O module slot 4 is powered on and ready for operation:
+
`system controller slot module show`
+
The output should show slot 4 status as `_powered-on_` and ready for operation for the cluster and HA I/O module you inserted.

. Verify that the replacement cluster and HA I/O module is online and recognized: 
+
Why use local here but node1 in other cmds?
+
`system controller config show -node local -slot4`
// was: `sysconfig -av _slot_number_`
+
If the replacement cluster and HA I/O module was successfully brought online and is recognize, the output shows I/O module information, including port information, for slot 4.
+
For example, you will see output similar to the following:
+
----
node1::> system controller config show -node node1 -slot 4

Node: node1

. Return the healthy controller (the controller that was taken over) to normal operation: 
+
`storage failover giveback -ofnode _healthy_node_name_`
+

. Restore automatic giveback from the console of the impaired controller (the controller that took over the healthy controller): 
+
`storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback _true_`
+
How come using local here too??

. If AutoSupport is enabled, restore automatic case creation:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end`
