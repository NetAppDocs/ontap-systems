This procedure is for 2-node, non-MetroCluster configurations only. If you have a system with more than two nodes, see https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/How_to_perform_a_graceful_shutdown_and_power_up_of_one_HA_pair_in_a_4__node_cluster[How to perform a graceful shutdown and power up of one HA pair in a 4-node cluster^]. 

.Before you begin
You need:

* Local administrator credentials for ONTAP.
* NetApp onboard key management (OKM) cluster-wide passphrase if using storage encryption.
* SP/BMC accessability for each controller.
* Stop all clients/host from accessing data on the NetApp system.
* Suspend external backup jobs.
* Necessary tools and equipment for the replacement.

NOTE: If the system is a NetApp StorageGRID or ONTAP S3 used as FabricPool cloud tier, refer to the https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/hardware/What_is_the_procedure_for_graceful_shutdown_and_power_up_of_a_storage_system_during_scheduled_power_outage#[Gracefully shutdown and power up your storage system Resolution Guide] after performing this procedure.

NOTE: If using FlexArray array LUNs, follow the specific vendor storage array documentation for the shutdown procedure to perform for those systems after performing this procedure.

NOTE: If using SSDs, refer to https://kb.netapp.com/Support_Bulletins/Customer_Bulletins/SU490[SU490: (Impact: Critical) SSD Best Practices: Avoid risk of drive failure and data loss if powered off for more than two months]

As a best practice before shutdown, you should:

* Perform additional https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/How_to_perform_a_cluster_health_check_with_a_script_in_ONTAP[system health checks].
* Upgrade ONTAP to a recommended release for the system.
* Resolve any https://activeiq.netapp.com/[Active IQ Wellness Alerts and Risks].
Make note of any faults presently on the system, such as LEDs on the system components.

.Steps

. Log into the cluster through SSH or log in from any node in the cluster using a local console cable and a laptop/console.
. Turn off AutoSupport and indicate how long you expect the system to be off line:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message "MAINT=8h Power Maintenance"`
. Identify the SP/BMC address of all nodes:
+
`system service-processor show -node * -fields address`

. Exit the cluster shell: `exit`
. Log into SP/BMC over SSH using the IP address of any of the nodes listed in the output from the previous step. 
+
If your're using a console/laptop, log into the controller using the same cluster administrator credentials.
+

NOTE: Open an SSH session to every SP/BMC connection so that you can monitor progress.

+
. Halt all nodes in the cluster: 
+
`system node halt -node * -skip-lif-migration-before-shutdown true -ignore-quorum-warnings true -inhibit-takeover true`.
+

NOTE: For clusters using SnapMirror synchronous operating in StrictSync mode: `system node halt -node * -skip-lif-migration-before-shutdown true -ignore-quorum-warnings true -inhibit-takeover true -ignore-strict-sync-warnings true`

. Enter *y* for each controller in the cluster when you see `_Warning: Are you sure you want to halt node "cluster name-controller number"?
{y|n}:_`

. Wait for each controller to halt and display the LOADER prompt.

. Turn off each PSU or unplug them if there is no PSU on/off switch.
. Unplug the power cord from each PSU.
. Verify that all controllers in the impaired chassis are powered down.
