This procedure is for systems with two node configurations. For more information about graceful shutdown when servicing a cluster, see https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/OHW/OHW-KBs/What_is_the_procedure_for_graceful_shutdown_and_power_up_of_a_storage_system_during_scheduled_power_outage[Gracefully shutdown and power up your storage system Resolution Guide - NetApp Knowledge Base] . 

.Before you begin

* Make sure you have the necessary permissions and credentials:
** Local administrator credentials for ONTAP.
** BMC accessability for each controller.

* Make sure you have the necessary tools and equipment for the replacement.
* As a best practice before shutdown, you should:

** Perform additional https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/How_to_perform_a_cluster_health_check_with_a_script_in_ONTAP[system health checks].
** Upgrade ONTAP to a recommended release for the system.
** Resolve any https://activeiq.netapp.com/[Active IQ Wellness Alerts and Risks].
Make note of any faults presently on the system, such as LEDs on the system components.

.Steps

. Log into the cluster through SSH or log in from any node in the cluster using a local console cable and a laptop/console.

. Stop all clients/host from accessing data on the NetApp system.
. Suspend external backup jobs.

. If AutoSupport is enabled, suppress case creation and indicate how long you expect the system to be offline:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message "MAINT=2h Replace chassis"`
. Identify the SP/BMC address of all cluster nodes:
+
`system service-processor show -node * -fields address`

. Exit the cluster shell:
+
`exit`

. Log into SP/BMC over SSH using the IP address of any of the nodes listed in the output from the previous step to monitor progress. 
+
If you are using a console/laptop, log into the controller using the same cluster administrator credentials.
+

. Halt the two nodes located in the impaired chassis: 
+
`system node halt -node <node1>,<node2> -skip-lif-migration-before-shutdown true -ignore-quorum-warnings true -inhibit-takeover true`
+

NOTE: For clusters using SnapMirror synchronous operating in StrictSync mode: `system node halt -node <node1>,<node2>  -skip-lif-migration-before-shutdown true -ignore-quorum-warnings true -inhibit-takeover true -ignore-strict-sync-warnings true`

. Enter *y* for each controller in the cluster when you see:
+
`Warning: Are you sure you want to halt node _<node_name>_? {y|n}:`

. Wait for each controller to halt and display the LOADER prompt.
