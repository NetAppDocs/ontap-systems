During the process of upgrading by moving storage, you power on node3 and node4, boot the software image, and configure the nodes. Physical port layout between original and new nodes can be different. Mapping of ports between original and replacement nodes should be done to identify proper layout of ports and connections.

.About this task
If the version of ONTAP running on the new nodes is different to the version on the original nodes, you must have downloaded the correct <ontap_version>_image.tgz file from the NetApp Support Site to a web-accessible directory (see Step 4). You need the <ontap_version>_image.tgz file to perform a netboot of your system.

.Steps
. Turn on the power to node3, and then immediately press Ctrl-C at the console terminal to access the LOADER prompt.
+
If node3 and node4 are in the same chassis, go to Step 2. If not, go to Step 3.

. If node3 and node4 are in a single-chassis configuration (with controllers in the same chassis):
 .. Attach a serial console to node4.
 .. Turn on the power to node4, if it is not already ON, and then interrupt the boot process by pressing Ctrl-C at the console terminal to access the LOADER prompt.
+
The power should already be ON if both controllers are in the same chassis.
+
Leave node4 at the LOADER prompt; you return to this procedure and repeat these steps after node3 is installed.
. At the LOADER prompt, enter the following command: `set-defaults`
. At the LOADER prompt, configure the netboot connection for a management LIF:
+
[options="header" cols="1,2"]
|===
| If IP addressing is...| Then...
a|
DHCP
a|
    Configure the automatic connection:

`ifconfig e0M -auto`
    a|
    Static
    a|
        Configure the manual connection:

`ifconfig e0M -addr=ip_addr -mask=netmask` `-gw=gateway`
|===

. At the LOADER prompt, perform netboot on the node3:
+
[options="header" cols="1,2"]
|===
| For...| Then...
a|
*FAS2200, FAS2500, FAS3200, FAS6200, FAS/AFF8000 series systems*
a|
`+netboot http://web_server_ip/path_to_web-accessible_directory/netboot/kernel+`
a|
*All other systems*
a|
`+netboot http://web_server_ip/path_to_web-accessible_directory/<ontap_version>_image.tgz+`
|===
The path_to_the_web-accessible_directory is the location of the downloaded <ontap_version>_image.tgz file.
+
NOTE: If you are unable to netboot the new controllers, contact technical support.

. From the boot menu, select option *(7) Install new software first* to download and install the new software image to the boot device.
+
Disregard the following message: "This procedure is not supported for Non-Disruptive Upgrade on an HA pair". It applies to nondisruptive upgrades of software, not to upgrades of controllers.

. If you are prompted to continue the procedure, enter `y`, and when prompted for the package, enter the URL of the image file: `+http://web_server_ip/path_to_web-accessible_directory/<ontap_version>_image.tgz+`.
+
Enter username/password if applicable, or press Enter to continue.

. Enter `n` to skip the backup recovery when you see a prompt similar to the following:
+
----
Do you want to restore the backup configuration now? {y|n}
----

. Reboot by entering `y` when you see a prompt similar to the following:
+
----
The node must be rebooted to start using the newly installed software. Do you want to reboot now? {y|n}
----

. Interrupt the reboot process by pressing Ctrl-C to display the boot menu when the system prompts you to do so.
. From the boot menu, select *(5) Maintenance mode boot* to access Maintenance mode.
. If necessary, make changes to the FC or CNA ports on the node, and then reboot the node to Maintenance mode.

. You should verify that the command output shows ha:
+
----
*> ha-config show
   Chassis HA configuration: ha
   Controller HA configuration: ha
----
+
Systems record in a PROM whether they are in an HA pair or stand-alone configuration. The state must be the same on all components within the stand-alone system or HA pair
+
The ha-config modify controller ha command configures ha for the controller setting. The ha-config modify chassis ha command configures ha for the chassis setting.

. Exit Maintenance mode: `halt`

The system stops at the LOADER prompt.
