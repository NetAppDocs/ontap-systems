You must remove the controller from the chassis when you replace the controller or replace a component inside the controller.

.Before you begin

Make sure all other components in the storage system are functioning properly; if not, you must contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] before continuing with this procedure.

.Steps
. On the impaired controller, make sure the NV LED is off.
+
When the NV LED is off, destaging is complete and it is safe to remove the impaired controller.
+
// The NV LED is off when destaging of the outstanding/uncommitted data to persistent flash (a partition on the boot media) has completed. Then it is safe to continue with this procedure.
+
NOTE: If the NV LED is flashing (green), destage is in progress. You must wait for the NV LED to turn off. However, if the flashing continues for longer than five minutes, contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] before continuing with this procedure.
+
The NV LED is located next to the NV icon on the controller.
