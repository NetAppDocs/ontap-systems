You can restore the ONTAP image (boot media recovery) from the partner node using the `boot_recovery -partner` with ASA r2 platforms running ONTAP 9.16.0 and later. 

When you boot a node and the boot media on that node is corrupted, you'll see the following messages and the boot process with stop at the LOADER prompt:

....

Can't find primary boot device u0a.0
Can't find backup boot device u0a.1
ACPI RSDP Found at 0x777fe014
 
 
Starting AUTOBOOT press Ctrl-C to abort...
Could not load fat://boot0/X86_64/freebsd/image1/kernel:Device not found
 
ERROR: Error booting OS on: 'boot0' file: fat://boot0/X86_64/Linux/image1/vmlinuz (boot0,fat)
 
 
ERROR: Error booting OS on: 'boot0' file: fat://boot0/X86_64/freebsd/image1/kernel (boot0,fat)
 
 
Autoboot of PRIMARY image failed. Device not found (-6)
LOADER-A>
....

If you see this message, you must restore the ONTAP image.

.Steps

. From the LOADER prompt, enter the _boot_recovery -partner_ command.
+
The screen will displays the message `Starting boot media recovery (BMR) process press Ctrl-C to abort...` and begins initial checks and installation of the boot recovery files.  

+
.. If External Key Manager (EKM) is configured, you will see the following displayed:
+

....
Error when fetching key manager config from partner 169.254.139.209: 28
Has key manager been configured on this system? {y|n}
....

.. Enter _y_ if a key manager has been configured.

+ 
....
key manager is configured.
Entering Bootmenu Option 11...
....

+
Bootmenu Option 11 will prompt the user for all of the EKM configuration information so that the configuration files can be rebuilt.


. Enter the EKM confiuration at each prompt.
+
*NOTE:* Most of this information was entered when EKM was originally enabled. You should enter the same information that was entered during initial EKM configuration. 
+

. Check that the `Keystore UUID` and `Cluster UUID` are correct. 
.. On the partner node retrieve the Cluster UUID with the  `cluster identity show` command.
.. On the partner node retrieve the Keystore UUID with the `vserver show -type admin` command and the `key-manager keystore show -vserver <nodename>` command.
.. Enter the values for Keystore UUID and Cluster UUID when prompted.
+
*NOTE:* If the partner node is not available, the Keystore UUID and Cluster UUID can be obtained from the Mroot-AK key located on the configured key server.
+
Verify the `x-NETAPP-ClusterName: <cluster name>` for the Cluster UUID and `x-NETAPP-KeyUsage: "MROOT-AK"` for the Keystore UUID attributes to ensure you have the correct keys.

. Monitor the retrieve and restore of Mroot-AK into the ONTAP node.
. If the process cannot restore the key, you will see the following message and need to configure e0M from the menu system shell: 
+

....

.. Run the `boot_recovery -partner` command on recoverery node.
.. When prompted to perform (y or n) option for EKM, select _n_ for all. 
+
After selecting _n_ option for the 8 prompts, the system will stop at boot menu.
+

.. Collect of the /cfcard/kmip/servers.cfg file from another cluster node, or, the following information:

* The KMIP server address.
* The KMIP port.
* The Keystore UUID.
* A copy of the /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.crt file from another cluster node, or, the client certificate.
* A copy of the /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.key file from another cluster node, or, the client key.
* A copy of the /cfcard/kmip/certs/CA.pem file from another cluster node, or, the KMIP server CA(s).
.. Enter systemshell from bootmenu by entering _systemshell_ at the prompt.
.. Configure network from the systemshell menu for e0M, netmask and gateway
.. Exit from menu systemshell.  You will see the boot menu.
.. Select `11` option to continue EKM.
.. Answer `y` to the following questions:

* Do you have a copy of the /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.crt file? {y/n} 
* Do you have a copy of the /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.key file? {y/n} 
* Do you have a copy of the /cfcard/kmip/certs/CA.pem file? {y/n} 
* Do you have a copy of the /cfcard/kmip/servers.cfg file? {y/n} 

. If the key is restored properly, the recovery process continues and reboots the node.
