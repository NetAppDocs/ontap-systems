You can restore the ONTAP image (boot media recovery) from the partner node using the `boot_recovery partner` with ASA r2 platforms running ONTAP 9.16.0 and later. 

When you boot a node wand the boot media on that node is corrupted, you'll see the following messages and the boot process with stop at the LOADER prompt:

----
