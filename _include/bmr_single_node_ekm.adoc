Restore the boot media image.

.Steps

. From the LOADER prompt, enter the _boot_recovery -partner_ command.
+
The screen will displays the message `Starting boot media recovery (BMR) process press Ctrl-C to abort...` and begins initial checks and installation of the boot recovery files.  

+
.. If External Key Manager (EKM) is configured, you will see the following displayed:
+

....
Error when fetching key manager config from partner 169.254.139.209: 28
Has key manager been configured on this system? {y|n}
....

.. Enter _y_ if a key manager has been configured.

+ 
....
key manager is configured.
Entering Bootmenu Option 11...
....

+
Bootmenu Option 11 will prompt the user for all of the EKM configuration information so that the configuration files can be rebuilt.


. Enter the EKM confiuration at each prompt.
+
*NOTE:* Most of this information was entered when EKM was originally enabled. You should enter the same information that was entered during initial EKM configuration. 
+

. Check that the `Keystore UUID` and `Cluster UUID` are correct. 
.. On the partner node retrieve the Cluster UUID with the  `cluster identity show` command.
.. On the partner node retrieve the Keystore UUID with the `vserver show -type admin` command and the `key-manager keystore show -vserver <nodename>` command.
.. Enter the values for Keystore UUID and Cluster UUID when prompted.
+
*NOTE:* If the partner node is not available, the Keystore UUID and Cluster UUID can be obtained from the Mroot-AK key located on the configured key server.
+
Verify the `x-NETAPP-ClusterName: <cluster name>` for the Cluster UUID and `x-NETAPP-KeyUsage: "MROOT-AK"` for the Keystore UUID attributes to ensure you have the correct keys.


. If the key is restored properly, the recovery process continues and reboots the node.
