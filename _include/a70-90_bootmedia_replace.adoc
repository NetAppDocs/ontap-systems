== Step 1: Replace the boot media

The boot media is located inside the System Management module and is accessed by removing the module from the system.

. Ensure that all drives in the chassis are firmly seated against the midplane by using your thumbs to push each drive until you feel a positive stop.

+
. Go to the rear of the chassis. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself. 

. Unplug the controller module power supply cables from the controller module power supplies (PSU).

+
NOTE: If your system has DC power, disconnect the power block from the PSUs. 
+

.. Remove any cables connected to the System Management module. Make sure to label where the cables were connected, so that you can connect them to the correct ports when you reinstall the module.
.. Rotate the cable management tray down by pulling the buttons on both sides on the inside of the cable management tray and then rotate the tray down. 
.. Depress the system management cam button.
The cam lever moves away from the chassis.
 .. Rotate the cam lever all the way down and remove the System Management module from the controller module.
.. Place the System Management module on an anti-static mat, so that the boot media is accessible.
. Remove the boot media from the management module:

== Step 2: Transfer the boot image to the boot media

The replacement boot media that you installed is without an ONTAP image. You can transfer the ONTAP image to the replacement boot media by downloading the appropriate ONTAP service image from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support Site] to a USB flash drive and then to the replacement boot media.

.Before you begin

 * You must have a USB flash drive, formatted to FAT32, with at least 4GB capacity.
 * Download a copy of the same image version of ONTAP as what the impaired controller was running. You can download the appropriate image from the Downloads section on the NetApp Support Site. Use the `version -v` command to display if your version of ONTAP supports NVE.  If the command output displays `<10no- DARE>`, your version of ONTAP does not support NVE.
 ** If NVE is supported by your version of ONTAP, download the image with NetApp Volume Encryption, as indicated in the download button.   
 ** If NVE is not supported, download the image without NetApp Volume Encryption, as indicated in the download button.

* If your system is an HA pair, you must have a network connection between the node management ports of the controllers (typically the e0M interfaces).
 
.Steps
 . Download and copy the appropriate service image from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support Site] to the USB flash drive.
.. Download the service image from the Downloads link on the page, to your work space on your laptop.
.. Unzip the service image.
+

NOTE: If you are extracting the contents using Windows, do not use WinZip to extract the netboot image. Use another extraction tool, such as 7-Zip or WinRAR.

+
 
The USB flash drive should have the appropriate ONTAP image of what the impaired controller is running.

+

.. Remove the USB flash drive from your laptop.
. Insert the USB flash drive into the USB-A port on the System Management module. 
+
Make sure that you install the USB flash drive in the slot labeled for USB devices, and not in the USB console port.

. Plug the power cords into the power supplies.

+
NOTE: If you have DC power supplies, reconnect the power block to the power supplies.

+ 
NOTE: The controller reboots as soon as power is restored.
+
 . Interrupt the boot process by pressing Ctrl-C to stop at the LOADER prompt.
+
If you miss this message, press Ctrl-C, select the option to boot to Maintenance mode, and then halt the controller to boot to LOADER.
