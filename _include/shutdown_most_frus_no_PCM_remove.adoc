To shut down the impaired controller, you must determine the status of the controller and, if necessary, take over the controller so that the healthy controller continues to serve data from the impaired controller storage.

.Before you begin
If you have a cluster with more than two nodes, it must be in quorum. If the cluster is not in quorum or a healthy controller shows false for eligibility and health, you must correct the issue before shutting down the impaired controller; see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/synchronize-node-cluster-task.html?q=Quorum[Synchronize a node with the cluster^].

.Steps
. If AutoSupport is enabled, suppress automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message command: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=number_of_hours_downh`
+
The following AutoSupport command suppresses automatic case creation for two hours: `cluster1:*> system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=2h`

. Disable automatic giveback from the console of the impaired controller: 
+
`storage failover modify -node impaired-node -auto-giveback-of false`
+
NOTE: When you see _Do you want to disable auto-giveback?_, enter `y`.

.. If the impaired controller cannot be brought up or is already taken over, you must take the HA interconnect link down from the healthy controller before booting up the impaired controller. This will prevent the impaired controller from performing automatic giveback.
+
`system ha interconnect link off -node healthy-node -link 0`
+
`system ha interconnect link off -node healthy-node -link 1`
. Take the impaired controller to the LOADER prompt:
+
[options="header" cols="1,2"]

System prompt or password prompt (enter system password)

Halt or take over the impaired controller from the healthy controller: `storage failover takeover -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`

When the impaired controller shows Waiting for giveback..., press Ctrl-C, and then respond `y`.
