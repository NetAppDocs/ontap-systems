.Before you begin

* If ONTAP is up and running (controller modules are available to serve data), you must have verified that all drives in the shelf are unowned, spares, or part of offlined aggregate(s).
+
You can verify the state of the drives by using the `storage disk show -shelf _shelf_number_` command. Output in the `Container Type` column should display `spare` or `broken` if it is a failed drive. Additionally, the `Container Name` and `Owner` columns should have a dash.

* You need a paper clip with one side straightened or a narrow-tipped ballpoint pen.
+
You use the paper clip or ballpoint pen to access the shelf ID button through the small hole, to the right of the LEDs, in the Operator Display Panel (ODP).

.About this task

* A valid shelf ID is 00 through 99.
* Shelf IDs must be unique within an HA pair.
* You must power cycle a shelf (unplug both power cords, wait the appropriate amount of time, and then plug them back in) in order for the shelf ID to take effect.
+
The amount of time you wait before plugging the power cords back in depends on the state of ONTAP, as described later in this procedure.
+
NOTE: NS224 shelves do not have power switches on the power supplies.
