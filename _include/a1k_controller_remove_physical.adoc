// Remove the controller module - A1K (modular)

You must remove the controller module from the enclosure when you replace the controller module or replace a component inside the controller module.

. Check the NVMEM LED located on the back of the system. There is also an NVMEM LED on the front panel of the controller module. Look for the NV icon:

NOTE: The green NV LED on the faceplate will start flashing when power is removed from the controller if the system was in the "waiting for giveback" state, or the system was not taken over or halted properly (uncommitted data).  If the impaired controller module was not successfully taken over by the partner controller module, contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support]

* If the green NV status LED begins flashing when the controller module is removed from the enclosure:

** Confirm that the controller had a clean takeover by the partner controller module or the impaired controller shows _waiting for giveback_, the flashing LED can be ignored and you can complete removing the impaired controller from the enclosure.

* If the green NV LED if off, you can complete removing the impaired controller from the enclosure.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Release the power cable hook and loop strap, and then unplug the cables from the power supplies.

IMPORTANT: Disconnecting the PSU is only required when servicing the NVRAM module and the System Management module.

. On the front of the unit, hook your fingers into the holes in the locking cams, squeeze the tabs on the cam levers, and gently, but firmly rotate both latches toward you at the same time.

The controller module moves slightly out of the enclosure.

Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the enclosure.
