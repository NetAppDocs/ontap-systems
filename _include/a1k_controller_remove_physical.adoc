NOTE: The green NV LED on the faceplate will start flashing when power is removed from the controller if the system was in the "waiting for giveback" state, or the system was not taken over or halted properly (uncommitted data).  If the impaired controller module was not successfully taken over by the partner controller module, contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support]

* If the green NV status LED begins flashing when the controller module is removed from the chassis:

** Confirm that the controller had a clean takeover by the partner controller module or the impaired controller shows _waiting for giveback_, the flashing LED can be ignored and you can complete removing the impaired controller from the chassis.

* If the green NV LED if off, you can complete removing the impaired controller from the chassis.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug the controller module power supplies from the power sources.
. Release the power cable hook and loop strap, and then unplug the cables from the power supplies.
. On the front of the unit, hook your fingers into the holes in the locking cams and gently, but firmly rotate both latches toward you at the same time.

The controller module moves slightly out of the chassis.

Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the chassis.
