Prior to shutting down the impaired controller and checking the status of the onboard encryption keys, you must check the status of the impaired controller, disable automatic giveback, and check the version of ONTAP that is running.

If you have a cluster with more than two nodes, it must be in quorum. If the cluster is not in quorum or a healthy controller shows false for eligibility and health, you must correct the issue before shutting down the impaired controller; see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/synchronize-node-cluster-task.html?q=Quorum[Synchronize a node with the cluster^].

.Steps

. Check the status of the impaired controller:
 ** If the impaired controller is at the login prompt, log in as `admin`.
 ** If the impaired controller is at the LOADER prompt and is part of HA configuration, log in as `admin` on the healthy controller.
. If AutoSupport is enabled, suppress automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=number_of_hours_downh`
+
The following AutoSupport message suppresses automatic case creation for two hours: `cluster1:*> system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=2h`

. Check the version of ONTAP the system is running on the impaired controller if up, or on the partner controller if the impaired controller is down, using the `version -v` command:

 ** If <lno-DARE> or <1Ono-DARE> is displayed in the command output, the system does not support NVE, proceed to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems/fas2800/bootmedia-impaired-controller-shutdown.html[Shut down the impaired controller].
 ** If <lno-DARE> is not not displayed in the command output, and the system is running ONTAP 9.6 or later, continue to the next section, <<Check NVE or NSE on systems running ONTAP 9.6 and later>>.
 . Disable automatic giveback from the healthy controller: 
 storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback false`
 or
 `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback-after-panic false`
