Before returning the replacement node to service, ensure the logical interfaces are on their home ports, check cluster health, and reset automatic giveback.

.Steps
 
. Verify that the logical interfaces are reporting to their home server and ports: 
+
`network interface show -is-home false`
+
If any logical interfaces are listed as false, return them to their home ports: 
+
`network interface revert -vserver * -lif *`

. Check the health of your cluster. See the https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/Ontap_OS/OS-KBs/How_to_perform_a_cluster_health_check_with_a_script_in_ONTAP[How to perform a cluster health check with a script in ONTAP^] KB article for more information.
