To replace the DIMMs, locate them inside the controller and follow the specific sequence of steps.

.Steps
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Open the controller air duct on the top of the controller.
.. Insert your fingers in the recesses at the far ends of the air duct.
.. Lift the air duct and rotate it upward as far as it will go.
. Locate the DIMMs on your controller module and identify the target DIMM.

+
Use the FRU map on the controller airduct to locate the DIMM slot. 

+

. Eject the DIMM from its slot by slowly pushing apart the two DIMM ejector tabs on either side of the DIMM, and then slide the DIMM out of the slot.
+
IMPORTANT: Carefully hold the DIMM by the edges to avoid pressure on the components on the DIMM circuit board.

. Remove the replacement DIMM from the antistatic shipping bag, hold the DIMM by the corners, and align it to the slot.
+
The notch among the pins on the DIMM should line up with the tab in the socket.

. Make sure that the DIMM ejector tabs on the connector are in the open position, and then insert the DIMM squarely into the slot.
+
The DIMM fits tightly in the slot, but should go in easily. If not, realign the DIMM with the slot and reinsert it.
+
IMPORTANT: Visually inspect the DIMM to verify that it is evenly aligned and fully inserted into the slot.

. Push carefully, but firmly, on the top edge of the DIMM until the ejector tabs snap into place over the notches at the ends of the DIMM.
. Close the controller air duct.
