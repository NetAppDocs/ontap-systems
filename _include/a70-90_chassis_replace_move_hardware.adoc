Remove the PSU, controller modules, drives, and impaired and then install the replacement chassis, controller modules, recable the controllers, install the drives, install the PSUs, and then boot the controllers and do a giveback.

== Step 1: Remove the PSUs

You need to remove all four of the PSUs in the controller before removing the controller.  Removing them lightens the overall weight of each controller.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug the controller module power supply cables from the controller module power supplies (PSU).

+
NOTE: If your system has DC power, disconnect the power block from the PSUs. 

. Remove the PSU by rotating the handle up, press the locking tab, and then pull PSU out of the controller module.
+
CAUTION: The PSU is short. Always use two hands to support it when removing it from the controller module so that it does not suddenly swing free from the controller module and injure you.

. Repeat these steps for the remaining PSUs.  

== Step 2:  Remove the controller modules

Remove the controllers from the chassis.

. Label the controller modules

. Unplug the system cables and SFP and QSFP modules (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.

. Remove the cable management device from the controller modules and set them aside. 

. Check the amber NVRAM that status LED located in slot 4/5 on the back of each controller module is off. Look for the NV icon.

* If the NV LED is off, go to the next step.
* If the NV LED is flashing, wait for the flashing to stop. If flashing continues for longer than 5 minutes, contact Technical Support for assistance.

Remove the controller modules:
.. Press down on both of the locking latches on the controller, and then rotate both latches downward at the same time.
+
The controller module moves slightly out of the chassis.

.. Slide the controller module out of the chassis and place it on a flat, stable surface.
+
Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the chassis.

. Repeat these steps for the second controller module.

== Step 3:  Remove the drives

You need to remove the drives from each bay opening in the impaired chassis.

. Gently remove the bezel from the front of the system.
. Remove the drives:
 .. Press the release button at the top of the carrier face below the LEDs.

 .. Pull the cam handle to its fully open position to unseat the drive from the midplane, and then gently slide the drive out of the chassis.
+
The drive should disengage from the chassis, allowing it to slide free of the chassis.
+
NOTE: When removing a drive, always use two hands to support its weight.
+
NOTE: Drives are fragile. Handle them as little as possible to prevent damage to them.

.. Keep track of what drive bay each drive was in and set the drives aside on a static-free cart or table.

.. Repeat this step for the remaining drives in the chassis.

== Step 4: Remove the impaired chassis 

You must remove the existing chassis from the equipment rack or system cabinet before you can install the replacement chassis.

. Remove the screws from the chassis mount points.
. With two people, slide the impaired chassis off the rack rails in a system cabinet or equipment rack, and then set it aside.

== Step 5: Install the replacement chassis

. Using two people or a lift, install the replacement chassis into the equipment rack or system cabinet by guiding the chassis onto the rack rails in a system cabinet or equipment rack.
. Slide the chassis all the way into the equipment rack or system cabinet.
. Secure the front of the chassis to the equipment rack or system cabinet, using the screws you removed from the impaired chassis.

== Step 6: Install the controller modules

Beginning with the bottom controller module, install the controllers into the replacement chassis.

. If you opened the air duct, close air duct by rotating it down as far as it will go.
+
It should lie flush against the controller module sheet metal.

. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller all the way into the chassis.

.. Rotate the locking latches upward into the locked position.
.. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device and recable the controller.
+
If you removed the media converters (QSFPs or SFPs), remember to reinstall them if you are using fiber optic cables.

. Repeat the preceding steps to install the second controller into the new chassis.

== Step 7:  Recable the controllers

Once the controller modules are installed, recable the controller modules.

. Reinstall the cable management devise in each controller.

. Reconnect the cables to the respective controller modules.

+
Make sure that the cables are connected referencing the cable labels.  Make sure the you reinsall and QSFP/SFP modules you may have removed.

== Step 8: Install the drives

Reinstall the drives in the corresponding controller slot.


== Step 9: Install the PSU

== Step 10: Boot the controllers and confirm giveback












== Step 3: Replace chassis from within the equipment rack or system cabinet

You must remove the existing chassis from the equipment rack or system cabinet before you can install the replacement chassis.

. Remove the screws from the chassis mount points.
. With two people, slide the old chassis off the rack rails in a system cabinet or equipment rack, and then set it aside.
. Using two people, install the replacement chassis into the equipment rack or system cabinet by guiding the chassis onto the rack rails in a system cabinet or equipment rack.
. Slide the chassis all the way into the equipment rack or system cabinet.
. Secure the front of the chassis to the equipment rack or system cabinet, using the screws you removed from the old chassis.
. Install the drives from the old chassis into the replacement chassis:
.. Align the drive from the old chassis with the same bay opening in the new chassis.
. Gently push the drive into the chassis as far as it will go.
+
The cam handle engages and begins to rotate upward.

.. Firmly push the drive the rest of the way into the chassis, and then lock the cam handle by pushing it up and against the drive carrier.
+
Be sure to close the cam handle slowly so that it aligns correctly with the front of the drive carrier. It clicks when it is secure.

.. Repeat the process for the remaining drives in the system.
. If you have not already done so, install the bezel.

== Step 4: Reinstall the controller modules

Reinstall the controller modules into the chassis and reboot them.

. If you opened the air duct, close air duct by rotating it down as far as it will go.
+
It should lie flush against the controller module sheet metal.

. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller all the way into the chassis.

.. Rotate the locking latches upward into the locked position.
.. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device and recable the controller.
+
If you removed the media converters (QSFPs or SFPs), remember to reinstall them if you are using fiber optic cables.

. Repeat the preceding steps to install the second controller into the new chassis.

. Plug the power cords into the power supplies.

+
NOTE: If you have DC power supplies, reconnect the power block to the power supplies after the controller module is fully seated in the chassis.

+
The controller module begins to boot as soon as it is installed and power is restored. If it boots to the LOADER prompt, reboot the controller with the `boot_ontap` command.
