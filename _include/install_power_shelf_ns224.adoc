Each shelf is distinguished by a unique shelf ID. This ID ensures that the shelf is distinct within your storage system setup.

.About this task
* A valid shelf ID is 01 through 99. 
+
If you have internal shelves (storage), which are integrated within the controllers, they are assigned a fixed shelf ID of 00.

* You must power cycle a shelf (unplug both power cords, wait the appropriate amount of time, and then plug them back in) for the shelf ID to take effect.

.Steps
. Power on the shelf by connecting the power cords first to the shelf, securing them in place with the power cord retainer, and then connecting the power cords to power sources on different circuits.
+
The shelf powers on and boots automatically when plugged into the power source. 

. Remove the left end cap to access the shelf ID button behind the faceplate.
