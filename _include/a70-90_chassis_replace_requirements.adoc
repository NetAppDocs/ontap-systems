The chassis is the physical enclosure housing all the controller components such as the controller/CPU unit, power supply, and I/O.

Before replacing the chassis, make sure to review the following requirements.

* Make sure all other components in the system are functioning properly; if not, contact http://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support Site^] for assistance.
* Obtain local administrator credentials for ONTAP if you don't have them.

* Make sure that you have the necessary tools and equipment for the replacement.

* You can use the chassis replacement procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your system.
* The chassis replacement procedure is written with the assumption that you are moving the bezel, NVMe drives, and controller modules to the new chassis, and that the replacement chassis is a new component from NetApp.
* *The chassis replacement procedure is disruptive.* For a two-node cluster, you will have a complete service outage and a partial outage in a multi-node cluster.
