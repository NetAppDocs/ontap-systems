Restore the onboard key manager configuration from the ONTAP boot menu.

.Before you begin

You need the following information while restoring the OKM configuration:

* Cluster-wide passphrase entered https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/encryption-at-rest/enable-onboard-key-management-96-later-nse-task.html[while enabling onboard key management].

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/encryption-at-rest/backup-key-management-information-manual-task.html[Backup information for the Onboard Key Manager].

* Perform the https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/Ontap_OS/OS-KBs/How_to_verify_onboard_key_management_backup_and_cluster-wide_passphrase[How to verify onboard key management backup and cluster-wide passphrase] procedure before proceeding.

.Steps

. Confirm that the controller's console displays `Waiting for giveback...(Press Ctrl-C to abort wait)`

. From the partner node, giveback the partner controller: `storage failover giveback -fromnode local -only-cfo-aggregates true`.

. Once booted only with CFO aggregate run the `security key-manager onboard sync` command. 


. Enter the cluster-wide passphrase for the Onboard Key Manager.

Enter the cluster-wide passphrase for the Onboard Key Manager:

All offline encrypted volumes will be brought online and the corresponding volume encryption keys (VEKs) will be restored automatically within 10 minutes. If any offline encrypted volumes are not brought online automatically, they can be brought online manually using the "volume online -vserver <vserver> -volume <volume_name>" command.

....

NOTE: If the sync is successful the cluster prompt is returned with no additional messages.  If the sync fails an error message appears before returning to the cluster prompt.  Do not continue until the the error is corrected and the sync runs successfully.

. Ensure that all keys are synced: `security key-manager key query -restored false`.
