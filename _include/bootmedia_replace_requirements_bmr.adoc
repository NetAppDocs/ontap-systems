Before replacing the boot media, make sure to review the following requirements.


* You must replace the failed boot media with a replacement boot media you received from NetApp.
* There must be no faulty cluster ports on the impaired controller.
* Determine if Onboard Key Manger (OKM) or Eternal Key Manager (EKM) is configured using one of the following methods:
** You can ask the system administrator if OKM or EKM are enabled.
** To check if OKM is enabled, you can use the `security key-manager onboard show`.
** To check if EKM is enabled, you can use the `security key-manager external show`.
* For OKM, you need the OKM passphrase file contents.
* For EKM, you need copies of the following files from the partner node:
** /cfcard/kmip/servers.cfg file.
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.crt file. 
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.key file.
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/CA.pem file.
