== New hardware enhancements

The hardware upgrade procedures have been simplified in ONTAP 9.8 with the introduction of the automatic port placement feature. When you are upgrading a system running ONTAP 9.8 you must use the correct procedure to account for the port placement feature.

Review the following table to see the available upgrade procedures. See each guide for additional details to determine if the procedure is appropriate.

For additional MetroCluster-specific procedures, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/upgrade/concept_choosing_an_upgrade_method_mcc.html[Choosing an upgrade or refresh method].
