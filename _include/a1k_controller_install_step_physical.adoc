Install the controller module

After you replace a FRU in the controller module, reinstall the controller module and reboot it.

. If you have not already done so, close the air duct:
.. Swing the air duct all the way down to the controller module until it locks into place.
.. Inspect the air duct to make sure that it is properly seated and locked into place.
. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Recable the system, as needed.
+
If you removed the media converters (QSFPs or SFPs), remember to reinstall them if you are using fiber optic cables.

. Plug the power cord into the power supply, reinstall the power cable hook and loop strap, and then connect the power supply to the power source if it was disconnected.
. Complete the reinstallation of the controller module:
 .. Firmly push the controller module into the chassis until it meets the midplane and is fully seated.
+
The locking cams rotate toward the controller module is fully seated.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
+
The controller module begins to boot as soon as it is fully seated in the chassis.

 .. Rotate the locking cams to the locked position.
 .. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
