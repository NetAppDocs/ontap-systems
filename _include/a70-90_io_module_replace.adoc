To replace an I/O module, remove the target I/O module from the chassis and then install the replacement I/O module into the chassis.

* You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your system.
* All other components in the system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller
 
Shut down or take over the impaired controller using one of the following options.

== Step 2: Replace I/O module

To replace an I/O module, locate it within the chassis and follow the specific sequence of steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Disconnect power by pulling the controller module out about three inches:

+
NOTE: If your system has DC power supplies, disconnect the power cable block from the PSU.
+
.. Press down on both of the locking latches, and then rotate both latches downward at the same time.
.. Pull the controller module about 3 inches out of the chassis to disengage power.
. Unplug any cabling on the target I/O module.
+
Make sure that you label the cables so that you know where they came from.

. Rotate the cable management arm down by pulling the buttons on the inside of the cable management arm and rotating it down.

. Remove the I/O module from the chassis:

Cam locking button

|===

.. Depress the cam latch button.
+
The cam latch moves away from the chassis.
.. Rotate the cam latch down as far as it will go. For horizontal modules, rotate the cam away from the module as far as it will go.
.. Remove the module from the chassis by hooking your finger into the cam lever opening and pulling the module out of the chassis.
+
Make sure that you keep track of which slot the I/O module was in.
+
. Set the I/O module aside.
. Install the replacement I/O module into the chassis by gently sliding the I/O module into the slot until the I/O cam latch begins to engage with the I/O cam pin, and then push the I/O cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. Recable the I/O module, as needed.
. Install the I/O module into the target slot:
.. Align the I/O module with the edges of the slot.
.. Gently slide the module into the slot all the way into the chassis, and then rotate the cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. Cable the I/O module.
. Repeat the remove and install steps to replace additional modules for the controller.
. Reinstall the controller module into the chassis.
+
NOTE: If you have DC power supplies, reconnect the cable blocks to the PSUs.
+
. Rotate the cable management arm into the locked position.

== Step 3: Reboot the controller

After you replace an I/O module, you must reboot the controller module.

NOTE: If the new I/O module is not the same model as the failed module, you must first reboot the BMC.

.Steps
. Reboot the BMC if the replacement module is not the same model as the old module:
.. From the LOADER prompt, change to advanced privilege mode: `set privilege advanced`
.. Reboot the BMC: `sp reboot`
. From the LOADER prompt, reboot the node: `bye`
+
NOTE: This reinitializes the I/O cards and other components and reboots the node.

+
NOTE: Be sure to exit Maintenance mode after completing the conversion.

. Return the node to normal operation: `storage failover giveback -ofnode impaired_node_name`

. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`

== Step 4: Return the failed part to NetApp
