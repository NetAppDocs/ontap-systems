Before replacing the boot media, make sure to review the following requirements and considerations.

== Requirements

* You must have a USB flash drive, formatted to FAT32, with the appropriate amount of storage to hold the `image_xxx.tgz`.

* You must copy the `image_xxx.tgz` file to the USB flash drive for later use in this procedure.

* You must replace the failed component with a replacement FRU component of the same capacity you received from your provider.


== Considerations

* It is important that you apply the commands in these steps on the correct controller:
** The _impaired_ controller is the controller on which you are performing maintenance.
** The _healthy_ controller is the HA partner of the impaired controller.

* If needed, you can turn on the platform chassis location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the affected platform. Log into the BMC using SSH and enter the `system location-led _on_` command.
+
A platform chassis has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each controller. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. 
+
You can turn them off by entering the `system location-led _off_` command. If you are unsure if the LEDs are on or off, you can check their state by entering the `system location-led show` command.
