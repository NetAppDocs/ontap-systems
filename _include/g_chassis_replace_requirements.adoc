Before replacing the chassis, make sure to review the following requirements and considerations.

== Requirements

* The replacement chassis must be the same model as the impaired chassis. This procedure is for a like-for-like replacement, not for an upgrade.

* All other components in the storage system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] before continuing with this procedure.


== Considerations

* *The chassis replacement procedure is disruptive.* For a two-node cluster, you will have a complete service outage and a partial outage in a multi-node cluster.

* You can use the chassis replacement procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your storage system.

* The chassis replacement procedure is written with the assumption that you are moving the bezel, drives, any drive blanks, and controllers to the new chassis.

* If needed, you can turn on the storage system location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the affected storage system. Log into the BMC using SSH and enter the `system location-led _on_` command.
+
A storage system has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each controller. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. 
+
You can turn them off by entering the `system location-led _off_` command. If you are unsure if the LEDs are on or off, you can check their state by entering the `system location-led show` command.
