+
.. Press the blue button on the boot media housing to release the boot media from its housing, and then gently pull it straight out of the boot media socket.

+
If necessary, remove the boot media and reseat it into the socket.

.. Push the boot media down to engage the locking button on the boot media housing.

. Reinstall the controller module lid by aligning the pins on the lid with the slots on the motherboard carrier, and then slide the lid into place.

.. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
.. Recable the controller module, as needed.
.. Push the controller module all the way into the system, making sure that the cam handle clears the USB flash drive, firmly push the cam handle to finish seating the controller module, and then push the cam handle to the closed position.
+
The controller begins to boot as soon as it is completely installed into the chassis.

If you miss this message, press Ctrl-C, select the option to boot to Maintenance mode, and then halt the controller to boot to LOADER.

. If the controller is in a stretch or fabric-attached MetroCluster, you must restore the FC adapter configuration:

 .. Set the MetroCluster ports as initiators: `ucadmin modify -m fc -t iniitator adapter_name`
 .. Halt to return to Maintenance mode: `halt`
