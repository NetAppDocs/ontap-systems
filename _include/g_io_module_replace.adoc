Use this procedure to replace a failed I/O module. 
// with the same type of I/O module. should be added because a FRU procedure is like-for-like...But Step 3 says you can replace with a different module. But isn;t this use case covered in I/O add when the slot is unavailable? 

.Before you begin
All other components in the storage system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] before continuing with this procedure.

.About this task
* You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your storage system.

* If needed, you can turn on the storage system location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the affected storage system. Log into the BMC using SSH and enter the `system location-led _on_` command.
+
A storage system has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each controller. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. 
+
You can turn them off by entering the `system location-led _off_` command. If you are unsure if the LEDs are on or off, you can check their state by entering the `system location-led show` command.


== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller
 
Shut down or take over the impaired controller.

// Shut down or take over the impaired controller using one of the following options.

== Step 2: Replace a failed I/O module

To replace a failed I/O module, locate it in the controller and follow the specific sequence of steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself. 

. Unplug cabling from the failed I/O module.
+
Make sure to label the cables so that you know where they came from.

. Remove the failed I/O module from the controller:

Turn the I/O module thumbscrew counterclockwise to loosen.

Pull the I/O module out of the controller using the port label tab on the left and the thumbscrew.

|===

. Install the replacement I/O module into the target slot:

.. Align the I/O module with the edges of the slot.

.. Gently slide the I/O module into the slot.

.. Turn the thumbscrew clockwise to tighten.

. Cable the I/O module.


== Step 3: Reboot the controller

After you replace an I/O module, you must reboot the controller.

NOTE: If the new I/O module is not the same type as the failed module, you must first reboot the BMC.

.Steps
. If the replacement I/O module is not the same type as the old module, reboot the BMC:
.. From the LOADER prompt, change to advanced privilege mode: _set privilege advanced_
.. Reboot the BMC: _sp reboot_
. Reboot the node from the LOADER prompt: _bye_
+
NOTE: This reinitializes the PCIe devices, other components, and reboots the node.
+
. Exit Maintenance mode after completing the conversion.

. Return the node to normal operation: _storage failover giveback -ofnode impaired_node_name_

. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it: _storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true_

== Step 4: Return the failed part to NetApp
