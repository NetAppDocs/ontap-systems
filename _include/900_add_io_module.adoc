You can add an I/O module to your system by either adding a new I/O nodule into a system with empty slots or by replacing an I/O module with a new one in a fully-populated system.

.Before you begin

* Check the https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe^] to make sure that the new I/O module is compatible with your system and version of ONTAP you're running.

* If multiple slots are available, check the slot priorities in https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe^]  and use the best one available for your I/O module.

* To non-disruptively add an I/O module, you must take over the target controller, remove the slot blanking cover in the target slot or remove an existing I/O module, add the new or replacement I/O module, and then giveback the target controller.

* Make sure that all other components are functioning properly.

== Option 1: Add the I/O module to a system with open slots

You can add an I/O module into an empty module slot in your system.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired node

Shut down or take over the impaired controller using one of the following options.

== Step 2: Add I/O modules

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Remove the target slot blanking cover:
 .. Depress the lettered and numbered cam latch.
 .. Rotate the cam latch down until it is the open position.
 .. Remove the blanking cover.
. Install the I/O module:
 .. Align the I/O module with the edges of the slot.
 .. Slide the I/O module into the slot until the lettered and numbered I/O cam latch begins to engage with the I/O cam pin.
 .. Push the I/O cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. If the replacement I/O module is a NIC, cable the module to the data switches.
+
NOTE: Make sure that any unused I/O slots have blanks installed to prevent possible thermal issues.

. Reboot the controller from the LOADER prompt: _bye_
+
NOTE: This reinitializes the PCIe cards and other components and reboots the node.

. Give back the controller from the partner controller. `storage failover giveback -ofnode target_node_name`
. Enable automatic giveback if it was disabled: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`
. If you are using slots 3 and/or 7 for networking, use the `storage port modify -node __<node name>__ -port __<port name>__ -mode network` command to convert the slot for networking use.
. Repeat these steps for controller B.
. If you installed a storage I/O module, install and cable your NS224 shelves, as described in https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems/ns224/hot-add-shelf.html[Hot-adding an NS224 drive shelf^].

== Option 2: Add an I/O module in a system with no open slots

If your system is fully populated, you can change an I/O module in an I/O slot by removing an existing I/O module and replacing it with a different I/O module.

== Step 2: Replace I/O modules
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug any cabling on the target I/O module.
. Remove the target I/O module from the chassis:
.. Depress the lettered and numbered cam latch.
+
The cam latch moves away from the chassis.
.. Rotate the cam latch down until it is in a horizontal position.
+
The I/O module disengages from the chassis and moves about 1/2 inch out of the I/O slot.
.. Remove the I/O module from the chassis by pulling on the pull tabs on the sides of the module face.
+
Make sure that you keep track of which slot the I/O module was in.

. Install the I/O module into the target slot:
.. Align the I/O module with the edges of the slot.
.. Slide the I/O module into the slot until the lettered and numbered I/O cam latch begins to engage with the I/O cam pin.
.. Push the I/O cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. Repeat the remove and install steps to replace additional modules for controller A.
. If the replacement I/O module is a NIC, cable the module or modules to the data switches.
. Reboot the controller from the LOADER prompt:
.. Check the version of BMC on the controller: `system service-processor show`
.. Update the BMC firmware if needed: `system service-processor image update`
.. Reboot the node: `bye`

NOTE: This reinitializes the PCIe cards and other components and reboots the node.
