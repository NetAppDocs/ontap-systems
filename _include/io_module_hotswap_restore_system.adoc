Restore your storage system to normal operation by giving back storage to the healthy controller, restoring automatic giveback, and reenabling AutoSupport automatic case creation.


.Steps

. Return the healthy controller (the controller that was taken over) to normal operation by giving back its storage: 
+
`storage failover giveback -ofnode _healthy_node_name_`
+
// The healthy controller should be in the "waiting for giveback" state.
+
. Restore automatic giveback from the console of the impaired controller (the controller that took over the healthy controller): 
+
`storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback _true_`

. If AutoSupport is enabled, restore automatic case creation:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end`
