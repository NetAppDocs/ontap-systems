// Install the controller module - AFF A20, A30, and AFF A50


Reinstall the controller and reboot it.

. Close the controller cover, by turning the thumbscrew clockwise until tightened.

. If you rotated the controller handles upright (but not in the locked position) to move them out of the way while you serviced the controller, rotate them down to the horizontal position.???

. Insert the controller halfway into the chassis.
+
Align the rear of the controller with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller using the handles.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller in the chassis until instructed to do so.
+

. Recable the controller, as needed.

. Fully seat the controller in the chassis:

.. Firmly push on the handles until the controller meets the midplane and is fully seated
.. Rotate the handles upward to the closed position and lock in place with the tabs.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller into the chassis; it could damage the connectors.
+

. Reconnect the power cable to the power supply on the impaired controller.

* If you have AC power supplies, reconnect the power cable to the power supply.

* If you have DC power supplies, reconnect the power block to the power supply.
+
NOTE: The controller boots when power is restored. If it boots to the LOADER prompt, reboot the controller with the boot_ontap command.

. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.

. If AutoSupport is enabled, restore/unsuppress automatic case creation by using the `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=END` command.
