.Steps

. Close the controller cover and turn the thumbscrew clockwise until tightened.

. Insert the controller halfway into the chassis.
+
Align the rear of the controller with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller using the handles.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Connect the console cable to the console port on the controller and to the laptop so that the laptop receives console messages when the controller reboots.
+
NOTE: Do not connect any other cables or power cords at this time.

. Fully seat the controller in the chassis:
+
.. Firmly push on the handles until the controller meets the midplane and is fully seated.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller into the chassis; it could damage the connectors.
+
.. Rotate the controller handles up and lock in place with the tabs.
+
NOTE: The replacement controller receives power from the healthy controller and begins to boot as soon as it is fully seated in the chassis.
+
. Recable the controller as needed.
+
. Reconnect the power cord to the power supply (PSU).
+
Once power is restored to the PSU, the status LED should be green.
