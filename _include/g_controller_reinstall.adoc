// Install the controller module - AFF A20, A30, and AFF A50


Reinstall the controller module and reboot it.

. Ensure the air duct is completely closed by rotating it down as far as it will go.
+
It must lie flush against the controller module sheet metal.
+
. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Recable the system, as needed.

+
If you removed the transceivers (QSFPs or SFPs), remember to reinstall them if you are using fiber optic cables.
. Complete the reinstallation of the controller module:
 .. Firmly push the controller module into the chassis until it meets the midplane and is fully seated.
+
The locking latches rise when the controller module is fully seated.

+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.


.. Rotate the locking latches upward into the locked position.

. Plug the power cords into the power supplies.

+
NOTE: If you have DC power supplies, reconnect the power block to the power supplies after the controller module is fully seated in the chassis.

+
The controller module boots when power is restored. If it boots to the LOADER prompt, reboot the controller with the `boot_ontap` command.

. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.

. If AutoSupport is enabled, restore/unsuppress automatic case creation by using the `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=END` command.
