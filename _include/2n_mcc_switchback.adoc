This task only applies to two-node MetroCluster configurations.

.Steps
. Verify that all nodes are in the `enabled` state: `metrocluster node show`

. Verify that resynchronization is complete on all SVMs: `metrocluster vserver show`
. Verify that any automatic LIF migrations being performed by the healing operations were completed successfully: `metrocluster check lif show`
. Perform the switchback by using the `metrocluster switchback` command from any node in the surviving cluster.
. Verify that the switchback operation has completed: `metrocluster show`
+
The switchback operation is still running when a cluster is in the `waiting-for-switchback` state:

cluster_B::> metrocluster show
Cluster              Configuration State    Mode
--------------------	------------------- 	---------
 Local: cluster_B configured       	switchover
Remote: cluster_A configured       	waiting-for-switchback
----
+
The switchback operation is complete when the clusters are in the `normal` state.:
+
----
cluster_B::> metrocluster show
Cluster              Configuration State    Mode
--------------------	------------------- 	---------
 Local: cluster_B configured      		normal
Remote: cluster_A configured      		normal
----
+
If a switchback is taking a long time to finish, you can check on the status of in-progress baselines by using the `metrocluster config-replication resync-status show` command.

. Reestablish any SnapMirror or SnapVault configurations.
