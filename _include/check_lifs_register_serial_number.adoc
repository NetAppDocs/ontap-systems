Before returning the _replacement_ node to service, you should verify that the LIFs are on their home ports, and register the serial number of the _replacement_ node if AutoSupport is enabled, and reset automatic giveback.

.Steps 
. Verify that the logical interfaces are reporting to their home server and ports: `network interface show -is-home false`
+
If any LIFs are listed as false, revert them to their home ports: `network interface revert -vserver * -lif *`

. Register the system serial number with NetApp Support.
** If AutoSupport is enabled, send an AutoSupport message to register the serial number.
** If AutoSupport is not enabled, call https://mysupport.netapp.com[NetApp Support] to register the serial number.

. Check the health of your cluster. See the https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/Ontap_OS/OS-KBs/How_to_perform_a_cluster_health_check_with_a_script_in_ONTAP[How to perform a cluster health check with a script in ONTAP^] KB article for more information.

. If an AutoSupport maintenance window was triggered, end it by using the `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=END` command.

. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`
