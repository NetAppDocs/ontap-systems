The procedure for booting the impaired controller from the recovery image depends on whether the system is in a two-node MetroCluster configuration.

== Option 1: Most systems

You must boot the ONTAP image from the USB drive, restore the file system, and verify the environmental variables.

This procedure applies to systems that are not in a two-node MetroCluster configuration.

.Steps
. From the LOADER prompt, boot the recovery image from the USB flash drive: `boot_recovery`
+
The image is downloaded from the USB flash drive.

. When prompted, either enter the name of the image or accept the default image displayed inside the brackets on your screen.
. Restore the `var` file system:

 .. Press `y` when prompted to restore the backup configuration.
 .. Set the healthy controller to advanced privilege level: `set -privilege advanced`
 .. Run the restore backup command: `system node restore-backup -node local -target-address _impaired_node_IP_address_`
 .. Return the controller to admin level: `set -privilege admin`
 .. Press `y` when prompted to use the restored configuration.
 .. Press `y` when prompted to reboot the controller.

 .. Press `n` when prompted to restore the backup configuration.
 .. Reboot the system when prompted by the system.
 .. Select the *Update flash from backup config* (sync flash) option from the displayed menu.

If you are prompted to continue with the update, press `y`.

. Ensure that the environmental variables are set as expected:
 .. Take the controller to the LOADER prompt.
 .. Check the environment variable settings with the `printenv` command.
 .. If an environment variable is not set as expected, modify it with the `setenv __environment-variable-name__ __changed-value__` command.
 .. Save your changes using the `savenv` command.
. The next depends on your system configuration:
 ** If your system has onboard keymanager, NSE or NVE configured, go to xref:bootmedia-encryption-restore.adoc[Restore OKM, NSE, and NVE as needed]
 ** If your system does not have onboard keymanager, NSE or NVE configured, complete the steps in this section.
. From the LOADER prompt, enter the `boot_ontap` command.

Waiting for giveback...

 .. Log into the partner controller.
 .. Confirm the target controller is ready for giveback with the `storage failover show` command.

+
|===

. Connect the console cable to the partner controller.
. Give back the controller using the `storage failover giveback -fromnode local` command.
. At the cluster prompt, check the logical interfaces with the `net int -is-home false` command.
+
If any interfaces are listed as "false", revert those interfaces back to their home port using the `net int revert` command.

. Move the console cable to the repaired controller and run the `version -v` command to check the ONTAP versions.
. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.
