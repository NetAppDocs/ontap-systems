Before replacing the boot media, make sure to review the following requirements.


* You must replace the failed component with a replacement FRU component you received from NetApp.
* It is important that you apply the commands in these steps on the correct controller:
 ** The _impaired_ controller is the controller on which you are performing maintenance.
 ** The _healthy_ controller is the HA partner of the impaired controller.
 * There must be no faulty cluster ports on the impaired controller.
