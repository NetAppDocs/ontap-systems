Review the following requirements.


* You must replace the failed boot media with a replacement boot media you received from NetApp.
* The cluster ports are used to communicate between the two controllers during the automated boot recovery process. Make sure that the cluster ports on the impaired controller are working properly.
* For OKM, you need the OKM passphrase file contents.
* For EKM, you need copies of the following files from the partner node:
** /cfcard/kmip/servers.cfg
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.crt
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.key
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/CA.pem

* It is critical to apply the commands to the correct controller when you are replacing the impaired boot media:

** The _impaired controller_ is the controller on which you are performing maintenance.
** The _healthy controller_ is the HA partner of the impaired controller.
