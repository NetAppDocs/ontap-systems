* For OKM, you need the OKM passphrase file contents.
* For EKM, you need copies of the following files from the partner node:
** /cfcard/kmip/servers.cfg file.
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.crt file. 
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/client.key file.
** /cfcard/kmip/certs/CA.pem file.

* It is critical to apply the commands to the correct controller when you are replacing the impaired boot media:

** The _impaired controller_ is the controller on which you are performing maintenance.
** The _healthy controller_ is the HA partner of the impaired controller.
