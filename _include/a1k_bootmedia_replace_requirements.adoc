Before replacing the boot media, make sure to review the following requirements.

* You must have a USB flash drive, formatted to FAT32, with the appropriate amount of storage to hold the `image_xxx.tgz`.

* You must copy the `image_xxx.tgz` file to the USB flash drive for later use in this procedure.

* You must replace the failed component with a replacement FRU component you received from your provider.
* It is important that you apply the commands in these steps on the correct controller:
 ** The _impaired_ controller is the controller on which you are performing maintenance.
 ** The _healthy_ controller is the HA partner of the impaired controller.
