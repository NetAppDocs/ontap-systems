Use this procedure to replace a failed I/O module.

* You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your storage system.
* All other components in the storage system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller
 
Shut down or take over the impaired controller.

== Step 2: Replace a failed I/O module

To replace an I/O module, locate it within the controller module and follow the specific sequence of steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself. 

. Unplug any cabling on the target I/O module.
+
Make sure to label the cables so that you know where they came from.

. Rotate the cable management tray down by pulling the buttons on the inside of the cable management tray and rotating it down.

. Remove the I/O module from the controller module:

+
NOTE: This following illustration shows removing a horizontal and vertical I/O module. Typically, you will only remove one I/O module.

Cam locking button

|===

.. Depress the cam latch button.
.. Rotate the cam latch do away from the module as far as it will go.
.. Remove the module from the controller module by hooking your finger into the cam lever opening and pulling the module out of the controller module.
+
Make sure that you keep track of which slot the I/O module was in.
+
. Set the I/O module aside.

. Install the replacement I/O module into the target slot:
.. Align the I/O module with the edges of the slot.
.. Gently slide the module into the slot all the way into the controller module, and then rotate the cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.

. Cable the I/O module.

. Repeat the remove and install steps to replace additional modules for the controller.

. Rotate the cable management tray into the locked position.

== Step 3: Reboot the controller

After you replace an I/O module, you must reboot the controller module.


.Steps

. From the LOADER prompt, reboot the node:`bye`  
+
NOTE: This reinitializes the I/O cards and other components and reboots the node.

+
NOTE: Be sure to exit Maintenance mode after completing the conversion.

. Return the node to normal operation: `storage failover giveback -ofnode impaired_node_name` 

. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` 

== Step 4: Return the failed part to NetApp
