== Step 2: Replace a failed I/O module

To replace an I/O module, locate it within the controller module and follow the specific sequence of steps.

.Steps
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself. 

. Unplug any cabling on the target I/O module.
+
Make sure to label the cables so that you know where they came from.

. Rotate the cable management tray down by pulling the buttons on the inside of the cable management tray and rotating it down.

. Set the I/O module aside.

. Install the replacement I/O module into the target slot:
