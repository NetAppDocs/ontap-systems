== Step 1: Verify HA config settings

You must verify the `HA` state of the controller module and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

. Boot to maintenance mode: `boot_ontap maint` 

.. Enter `y` when you see _Continue with boot?_.
+
If you see the _System ID mismatch_ warning message, enter `y`.

. Enter `sysconfig -v` and capture the display contents.

+
NOTE: If you see _PERSONALITY MISMATCH_ contact customer support.

. From the `sysconfig -v` output, compare the adapter card information with the cards and locations in the replacement controller.

== Step 2: Verify disk list

. Verify that the adapter lists the paths to all disks: 
+
`storage show disk -p`
+
If you see any issues, check cabling and reseat cables.

. Exit Maintenance mode: 
+
`halt`
