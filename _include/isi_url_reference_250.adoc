NOTE: The ASA A250 and ASA C250 use the same installation procedure as the AFF A250 system.

//March 20, 204, this section below is being removed since it appears that the Japanese and simplified Chinese versions should not have been included (at initial release of AFF A250) and maintaining these is not feasible. Metrics on hits/usage is forthcoming. Once confirmed, this note and the section below will be removed.
