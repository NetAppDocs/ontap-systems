To replace the boot media, you must remove the impaired controller, remove the boot media, install the replacement boot media, and transfer the boot image to a USB flash drive.

== Step 1: Remove the controller

include::../_include/g_controller_remove.adoc[]

. Place the controller on an anti-static mat.

. Open the controller cover by turning the thumbscrew counterclockwise to loosen, and then open the cover.


== Step 2: Replace the boot media

To replace the boot media, locate it inside the controller and follow the specific sequence of steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself. 

. Remove the boot media:

Gently pull the left end of the boot media out of its socket.

. Install the replacement boot media:
.. Remove the boot media from its package.
.. Slide the socket end of the boot media into its socket.
.. At the opposite end of the boot media, press down and hold the blue tab (in the open position), gently push down on that end of the boot media until it stops, and then release the tab to lock the boot media into place.

== Step 3: Reinstall the controller

Reinstall the controller into the chassis, but do not reboot it.

.About this task

The following illustration shows the operation of the controller handles (from the left side of a controller) when reinstalling the controller, and can be used as a reference for the rest of the controller reinstallation steps.

If you rotated the controller handles upright (next to the tabs) to move them out of the way while you serviced the controller, rotate them down to the horizontal position.

Push the handles to reinsert the controller into the chassis halfway and then, when instructed, push until the controller is fully seated.

Rotate the handles to the upright position and lock in place with the locking tabs.

.Steps

. Close the controller cover and turn the thumbscrew clockwise until tightened.

. Insert the controller halfway into the chassis.
+
Align the rear of the controller with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller using the handles.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller in the chassis until instructed to do so later in this procedure.
+

. Reconnect the cables to the controller; however, do not plug in the power cord to the power supply (PSU) at this time.
+
NOTE: Make sure that the console cable is connected to the controller because you want to catch and log the boot sequence later in the boot media replacement procedure when you fully seat the controller in the chassis and it begins to boot.


== Step 4: Transfer the boot image to the boot media

The replacement boot media that you installed is without an ONTAP image so you need to transfer an ONTAP image using a USB flash drive.

.Before you begin

 * You must have a USB flash drive, formatted to FAT32, with at least 4GB capacity.
 * You must have a copy of the same image version of ONTAP as what the impaired controller was running. You can download the appropriate image from the https://support.netapp.com/downloads[Downloads] section on the NetApp Support Site
  ** If NVE is supported, download the image with NetApp Volume Encryption, as indicated in the download button.
  ** If NVE is not supported, download the image without NetApp Volume Encryption, as indicated in the download button.
 * You must have a network connection between the node management ports of the controllers (typically the e0M interfaces).
 
.Steps
 . Download and copy the appropriate service image from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support Site] to the USB flash drive.
.. Download the service image from the Downloads link on the page, to your work space on your laptop.
.. Unzip the service image.
+

NOTE: If you are extracting the contents using Windows, do not use WinZip to extract the netboot image. Use another extraction tool, such as 7-Zip or WinRAR.
+

The USB flash drive should have the appropriate ONTAP image of what the impaired controller is running.

.. Remove the USB flash drive from your laptop.
. Insert the USB flash drive into the USB-A port on the impaired controller. 
+
Make sure that you install the USB flash drive in the slot labeled for USB devices, and not in the USB console port.

. Fully seat the impaired controller in the chassis:
.. Firmly push on the handles until the controller meets the midplane and is fully seated.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller into the chassis; it could damage the connectors.
+
NOTE: The controller boots when fully seated in the chassis. It gets its power from the partner controller.
+
.. Rotate the controller handles up and lock in place with the tabs.

. Interrupt the boot process by pressing Ctrl-C to stop at the LOADER prompt.
+
If you miss this message, press Ctrl-C, select the option to boot to Maintenance mode, and then halt the controller to boot to LOADER.

. Reconnect the power cord to the power supply (PSU) on the impaired controller.
+
Once power is restored to the PSU, the status LED should be green.
