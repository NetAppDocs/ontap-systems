You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your storage system.

.Before you begin
* You must have the replacement part available.

* Make sure all other components in the storage system are functioning properly; if not, contact technical support.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired node

Shut down or take over the impaired controller.

== Step 2: Replace a failed I/O module

To replace an I/O module, locate it within the enclosure and follow the specific sequence of steps.

.Steps
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.

. Unplug any cabling on the target I/O module.
. Rotate the cable management tray down by pulling the buttons on both sides on the inside of the cable management tray and then rotate the tray down.

+
NOTE: This following illustration shows removing a horizontal and vertical I/O module. Typically, you will only remove one I/O module.

Make sure that you label the cables so that you know where they came from.

. Remove the target I/O module from the enclosure:
.. Depress the cam button on the target module.
.. Rotate the cam latch away from the module as far as it will go.
.. Remove the module from the enclosure by hooking your finger into the cam lever opening and pulling the module out of the enclosure.
+
Make sure that you keep track of which slot the I/O module was in.

. Set the I/O module aside.
. Install the replacement I/O module into the enclosure:
.. Align the module with the edges of the enclosure slot opening.
.. Gently slide the module into the slot all the way into the enclosure, and then rotate the cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. Cable the I/O module.
. Rotate the cable management tray up to the closed position.
