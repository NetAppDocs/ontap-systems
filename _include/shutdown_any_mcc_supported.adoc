NOTE: Do not use this procedure if your system is in a two-node MetroCluster configuration.

To shut down the impaired controller, you must determine the status of the controller and, if necessary, take over the controller so that the healthy controller continues to serve data from the impaired controller storage.

* If you have a cluster with more than two nodes, it must be in quorum. If the cluster is not in quorum or a healthy controller shows false for eligibility and health, you must correct the issue before shutting down the impaired controller; see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/synchronize-node-cluster-task.html?q=Quorum[Synchronize a node with the cluster^].

* If you have a MetroCluster configuration, you must have confirmed that the MetroCluster Configuration State is configured and that the nodes are in an enabled and normal state (`metrocluster node show`).

.Steps
. If AutoSupport is enabled, suppress automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=number_of_hours_downh`
+
The following AutoSupport message suppresses automatic case creation for two hours: `cluster1:*> system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=2h`

. Disable automatic giveback from the console of the healthy controller: `storage failover modify â€“node local -auto-giveback false`
. Take the impaired controller to the LOADER prompt:

Take over or halt the impaired controller from the healthy controller: `storage failover takeover -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`

When the impaired controller shows Waiting for giveback..., press Ctrl-C, and then respond `y`.
