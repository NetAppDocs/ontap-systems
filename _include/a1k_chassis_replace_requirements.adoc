The chassis is the physical chassis housing all the system components such as the fans, controller/CPU unit, NVRAM12, system management module, I/O cards and blanking modules, and PSUs.

Review the following requirements.

* Make sure all other components in the system are functioning properly; if not, contact http://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp support^] for assistance.

* Obtain local administrator credentials for ONTAP if you don't have them.

* Make sure that you have the necessary tools and equipment for the replacement.

* You can use the chassis replacement procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your system.

* The chassis replacement procedure is written with the assumption that you are moving the bezel, fans, controller module, NVRAM12, system management module, I/O cards and blanking modules, and PSUs to the new chassis, and that the replacement chassis is a new component from NetApp.
