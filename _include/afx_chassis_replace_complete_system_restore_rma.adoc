== Step 1: Boot the controllers and give back the controllers 
After the controllers reboot, boot ONTAP and give back the controllers.

.Steps
. Check the console output:
.. If the controller stop at the LOADER prompt, boot the controller with the `boot_ontap` command.

.. Once the node boots and provides the login prompt, log into the partner controller and check that the replaced controller is ready for giveback with `storage failover show` command.

. Perform the giveback:

.. Connect the console cable to the partner controller.
.. Press <enter> when console messages stop.
* If you see the _login_ prompt, go to the next step.
* If you do not see login prompt, log into the partner node.
.. Give back only the root with override-destination-checks option:
+
`storage failover giveback -ofnode impaired-node -only-root true -override -destination-checks true`
+
NOTE: The following command is only available in the Diagnostic mode privilege level. For more information on privilege levels, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/administrative-privilege-levels-concept.html[Understand the privilege levels for ONTAP CLI commands^]. 
+
If you encounter errors, contact https://support.netapp.com[NetApp Support].

.. Wait 5 minutes after the giveback report completes, and check failover status and giveback status:
+
`storage failover show` and `storage failover show-giveback`
+
NOTE: The following command is only available in the Diagnostic mode privilege level.
.. If the HA internconnect links were taken down, bring them back up:
+
`system ha interconnect link on -node healthy-node -link 0`
+
`system ha interconnect link on -node healthy-node -link 1`

.. Return the impaired controller to normal operation by giving back its storage: 
+
`storage failover giveback -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`

.. If automatic giveback was disabled, reenable it: `storage failover modify -node _impaired_node_name_ -auto-giveback-of _true_`

.. If AutoSupport is enabled, restore/unsuppress automatic case creation: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=END`

== Step 2: Verify storage system health

After the controller has given back the storage, you should check the overall health with https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[Active IQ Config Advisor].

.Steps
. After the giveback is complete, run Active IQ Config Advisor to verify the health of the storage system.
. Correct any issues you encounter.


== Step 3: Return the failed part to NetApp
