+
NOTE: If your storage system has DC power supplies, disconnect the power cable block from the power supply units (PSUs).
+
.. Remove any cables connected to the System Management module. Make sure that you label where the cables were connected, so that you can connect them to the correct ports when you reinstall the module. 
.. Rotate the cable management tray down by pulling the buttons on both sides on the inside of the cable management tray and then rotate the tray down.
.. Depress the System Management cam button.
.. Rotate the cam latch down as far as it will go.

== Step 2: Transfer the ONTAP image to the boot media

The replacement boot media that you installed is without an ONTAP image, You can transfer the ONTAP image to the replacement boot media by downloading the appropriate ONTAP service image from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support Site] to a USB flash drive and then to the replacement boot media.

.Before you begin

 * You must have an empty USB flash drive, formatted to FAT32, with at least 4GB capacity.
 * You must have a copy of the same image version of ONTAP as what the impaired controller was running. You can download the appropriate image from the https://support.netapp.com/downloads[Downloads] section on the NetApp Support Site
  ** If NVE is supported, download the image with NetApp Volume Encryption, as indicated in the download button.
  ** If NVE is not supported, download the image without NetApp Volume Encryption, as indicated in the download button.
 * If your system is an HA pair, you must have a network connection between the node management ports of the controllers (typically the e0M interfaces).

.Steps
. Download and copy the appropriate service image from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support Site] to the USB flash drive.
.. Download the service image from the Downloads link on the page, to your work space on your laptop.
.. Unzip the service image.
+

NOTE: If you are extracting the contents using Windows, do not use WinZip to extract the netboot image. Use another extraction tool, such as 7-Zip or WinRAR.

+
 
The USB flash drive should have the appropriate ONTAP image of what the impaired controller is running.

.. Remove the USB flash drive from your laptop.
. Insert the USB flash drive into the USB slot on the System Management module. 
+
Make sure that you install the USB flash drive in the slot labeled for USB devices, and not in the USB console port.

 . Plug the power cables into the power supplies and reinstall the power cable retainer.

+
The controller begins to boot as soon as power is reconnected to the system.

 . Interrupt the boot process by pressing Ctrl-C to stop at the LOADER prompt.
+
If you miss this message, press Ctrl-C, select the option to boot to Maintenance mode, and then halt the controller to boot to LOADER.

. Set your network connection type at the LOADER prompt:
 ** If you are configuring DHCP: `ifconfig e0M -auto`
+
NOTE: The target port you configure is the target port you use to communicate with the impaired controller from the healthy controller during var file system restore with a network connection. You can also use the e0M port in this command.

 ** If you are configuring manual connections: `ifconfig e0M -addr=filer_addr -mask=netmask -gw=gateway`
  *** filer_addr is the IP address of the storage system.
  *** netmask is the network mask of the management network that is connected to the HA partner.
  *** gateway is the gateway for the network.
  
+
NOTE: Other parameters might be necessary for your interface. You can enter help ifconfig at the firmware prompt for details.
