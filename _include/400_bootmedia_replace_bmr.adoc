The boot media is located inside the controller module under the air duct, and is accessed by removing the controller module from the system.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Release the power cable retainers, and then unplug the cables from the power supplies.
. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables and SFPs (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.

. Remove the cable management device from the controller module and set it aside.
. Press down on both of the locking latches, and then rotate both latches downward at the same time.
+
The controller module moves slightly out of the chassis.

Controller moves slightly out of chassis
|===

. Slide the controller module out of the chassis.
+
Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the chassis.

. Place the controller module on a stable, flat surface.

. Open the air duct:

Rotate air duct up
|===

 .. Press the locking tabs on the sides of the air duct in toward the middle of the controller module.
 .. Slide the air duct toward the back of the controller module, and then rotate it upward to its completely open position.
. Locate and remove the boot media from the controller module:

Rotate boot media up and remove from socket
|===
 .. Press the blue button at the end of the boot media until the lip on the boot media clears the blue button.
 .. Rotate the boot media up and gently pull the boot media out of the socket.
. Align the edges of the replacement boot media with the boot media socket, and then gently push it into the socket.
. Check the boot media to make sure that it is seated squarely and completely in the socket.
+
If necessary, remove the boot media and reseat it into the socket.

. Lock the boot media in place:
 .. Rotate the boot media down toward the motherboard.
 .. Placing a finger at the end of the boot media by the blue button, push down on the boot media end to engage the blue locking button.
 .. While pushing down on the boot media, lift the blue locking button to lock the boot media in place.
. Close the air duct.



== Step 3: Transfer the boot image to the boot media

. Reinstall the controller module:
.. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
.. Reinstall the cable management device and recable the system, as needed.
+
When recabling, remember to reinstall the media converters (SFPs or QSFPs) if they were removed.

.. Plug the power cable into the power supply and reinstall the power cable retainer.
.. Firmly push the controller module into the chassis until it meets the midplane and is fully seated.
+
The locking latches rise when the controller module is fully seated.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
.. Rotate the locking latches upward, tilting them so that they clear the locking pins, and then lower them into the locked position.
.. Reconnect the PSUs to the power source.
+
The controller module begins to boot as soon as ithe power supplies are plugged into the power sourc. Be prepared to interrupt the boot process.

 
 .. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
. Interrupt the boot process by pressing Ctrl-C to stop at the LOADER prompt.
+
If you miss this message, press Ctrl-C, select the option to boot to Maintenance mode, and then `halt` the controller to boot to LOADER.

. If the controller is in a stretch or fabric-attached MetroCluster, you must restore the FC adapter configuration:
 .. Boot to Maintenance mode: `boot_ontap maint`
 .. Set the MetroCluster ports as initiators: `ucadmin modify -m fc -t _initiator adapter_name_`
 .. Halt to return to Maintenance mode: `halt`

+
The changes will be implemented when the system is booted.
