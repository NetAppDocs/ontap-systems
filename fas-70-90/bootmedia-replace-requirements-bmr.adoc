Before replacing the boot media in your FAS70 or FAS90 storage system, ensure you meet the necessary requirements for a successful replacement. This includes verifying that you have the correct replacement boot media, confirming the cluster ports on the impaired controller are working properly, and determining whether Onboard Key Manager (OKM) or External Key Manager (EKM) is enabled.

The automated boot media recovery process is supported only in ONTAP 9.17.1 and later. If your storage system is running an earlier version of ONTAP, use the link:bootmedia-replace-workflow.html[manual boot recovery procedure].
