You can replace a failed boot media manually by using USB module for the boot image.

Manual boot media replace uses the traditional method of downloading the ONTAP image from the NetApp support site, transferring the image to a USB drive, downloading it to the target replacement boot media, and manually walking through the boot menu options to install the ONTAP image on the replacement boot media.
