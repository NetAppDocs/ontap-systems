Hot-swap a cluster/HA I/O module in your AFF A20, AFF A30, or AFF A50 storage system when the module fails. The process involves preparing the I/O module slot for removal, hot-swapping the failed cluster/HA I/O module for an equivalent module, bringing the replacement cluster/HA I/O module online, and returning the failed part to NetApp.
