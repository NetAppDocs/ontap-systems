summary: Hot-swap a cluster/HA I/O module in your AFF A20, AFF A30, or AFF A50 storage system when the module fails. The process involves preparing the I/O module slot for removal, hot-swapping the failed cluster/HA I/O module for an equivalent module, bringing the replacement cluster/HA I/O module online, and returning the failed part to NetApp.

//Jul 25, 2025: GH issue #1185 to support I/O hot-swap of cluster/HA I/O module in slot 4 for g- platform family.

[.lead]
Hot-swap a cluster/HA I/O module in your AFF A20, AFF A30, or AFF A50 storage system when the module fails. The process involves preparing the I/O module slot for removal, hot-swapping the failed cluster/HA I/O module for an equivalent module, bringing the replacement cluster/HA I/O module online, and returning the failed part to NetApp.

.Before you begin
* Your storage system must meet all of the following requirements in order to use this procedure; otherwise, you must use the link:io-module-replace.html[replace an I/O module procedure].
** Your storage system must be running ONTAP 9.17.1 or later.
** The I/O module that failed must be a cluster/HA module (in slot 4) and you must be replacing it with an equivalent module. You cannot change the module type.
** Your storage system configuration must have only one cluster/HA module (located in slot 4), not two cluster/HA modules.
** The controller with the failed cluster/HA I/O module must have taken over the healthy controller. The take over should have occured automatically if the module is failed.
+
You can verify the take over state...
** Your storage system must be a two-node cluster configuration.

* All other components in the storage system must be functioning properly; if not, contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] before continuing with this procedure.

.About this task

* It is critical to apply the commands to the correct controller when you are performing maintenance:

** The _impaired controller_ is the controller on which you are performing maintenance.
** The _healthy controller_ is the HA partner of the impaired controller.

* If needed, you can turn on the storage system location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the affected storage system. Log into the BMC using SSH and enter the `system location-led _on_` command.
+
A storage system has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each controller. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. 
+
You can turn them off by entering the `system location-led _off_` command. If you are unsure if the LEDs are on or off, you can check their state by entering the `system location-led show` command.


== Step 1: Prepare the I/O module slot 4

// New include specific to g-platform family because the slot 4 location for the cluster/HA I/O module is unique to g-platforms.

include::../_include/g_io_module_hotswap_ha_slot4_prepare_slot.adoc[]


== Step 2: Replace the failed cluster/HA I/O module

// New include specific to g-platform family because the hardware hot-swap steps for a cluster/HA I/O module in slot 4 are unique to g-platforms.

include::../_include/g_io_module_hotswap_ha_slot4_swap_hardware.adoc[]


== Step 3: Bring the replacement cluster/HA I/O module online

// New include specific to g-platform family because the steps for bringing the replacement cluster/HA I/O module online specific/reference slot 4 and so is unique to g-platforms.

== Step 4: Return the failed part to NetApp
