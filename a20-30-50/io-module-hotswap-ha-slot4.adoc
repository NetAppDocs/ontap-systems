//Jul 25, 2025: GH issue #1185 to support hot-swap of cluster/HA I/O module in slot 4 for g-platform family on 9.17.1 and later.

[.lead]
The cluster and HA I/O module supports interconnects for clustering and high-availability. You can hot-swap the module in your AFF A20, AFF A30, or AFF A50 storage system when the module fails and if your storage system meets specific requirements.

The hot-swap process involves preparing the storage system and I/O module slot 4 so that it's safe to remove the failed module, hot-swapping the failed module for an equivalent one, bringing the replacement module online, restoring the storage system to normal operation, and returning the failed module to NetApp.


== Step 1: Ensure the storage system meets the procedure requirements

// New include specific to g-platform family because the requirements reference 9.17.1 and slot 4, which are unique to g-platforms.

include::../_include/g_io_module_hotswap_ha_slot4_requirements.adoc[]


== Step 2: Prepare the storage system and I/O module slot 4

// New include specific to g-platform family because the slot 4 location for the cluster and HA I/O module is unique to g-platforms.

include::../_include/g_io_module_hotswap_ha_slot4_prepare_slot.adoc[]


== Step 3: Replace the failed cluster and HA I/O module

// New include specific to g-platform family because the hardware hot-swap steps for a cluster and HA I/O module in slot 4 are unique to g-platforms.

include::../_include/g_io_module_hotswap_ha_slot4_swap_hardware.adoc[]


== Step 4: Bring the replacement cluster and HA I/O module online

// New include specific to g-platform family because the steps for bringing the replacement cluster and HA I/O module online specify/reference slot 4, which is unique to g-platforms.

include::../_include/g_io_module_hotswap_ha_slot4_bring_online.adoc[]


== Step 5: Restore the storage system to normal operation

// New include that's generic - can be used for the g-platform family and v-platform family.

== Step 6: Return the failed part to NetApp
