After you install your AFF A20, AFF A30, or AFF A50 storage system hardware, cable the controllers to the network and shelves.

.About this task
The cabling graphics have arrow icons showing the proper orientation of the cable connector pull-tab when inserting a connector into a port.

image::../media/drw_cable_pull_tab_direction_ieops-1699.svg[Cable pull tab orientation example]

* As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it over and try again.
* If cabling to an optical switch, insert the small form-factor pluggable (SFP) transceiver into the controller port before the switch port.


== Step 1: Cable the controllers to your network
Cable the controllers to your host network.

.Before you begin

Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the storage system to the switches.

.About this task
These procedures show common configurations. Keep in mind that the specific cabling depends on the components ordered for your storage system. For comprehensive configuration and slot priority details, see link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^].
