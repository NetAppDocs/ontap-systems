After you install your AFF A20, AFF A30, or AFF A50 storage system hardware, cable the controllers to the network and shelves.

.About this task
* The cabling graphics have arrow icons showing the proper orientation (up or down) of the cable connector pull-tab when inserting a connector into a port.
+
As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it over and try again.

* If cabling to an optical switch, insert the small form-factor pluggable (SFP) transceiver into the controller port before the switch port.


== Step 1: Cable the controllers to your network
Cable the controllers to your host network.

.Before you begin

Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the storage system to the switches.

.About this task
These procedures show common configurations. Keep in mind that the specific cabling depends on the components ordered for your storage system. For comprehensive configuration and slot priority details, see link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^].

== Step 2: Cable the controllers to the shelves
This procedure shows how to cable the controllers to one NS224 shelf.

For the maximum number of shelves supported for your storage system, see link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^].

.About this task
* You cable each controller to each NSM module on the NS224 shelf using the following cable type:
+
*100 GbE QSFP28 copper cables*
+
image::../media/oie_cable100_gbe_qsfp28.png[100 GbE QSFP28 copper cable,width=100px]
* The graphics show controller A cabling in blue and controller B cabling in yellow. 

.Steps

. Cable controller A to the shelf:
.. Cable controller A port e3a to NSM A port e1a.
.. Cable controller A port e3b to NSM B port e1b.
+
image:../media/drw_isi_g_1_ns224_controller_a_cabling_ieops-1945.svg[Controller A ports e3a and e3b cabled to one NS224 shelf]

. Cable controller B to the shelf:
.. Cable controller B port e3a to NSM B port e1a.
.. Cable controller B port e3b to NSM A port e1b.
+
image:../media/drw_isi_g_1_ns224_controller_b_cabling_ieops-1946.svg[Controller B ports e3a and e3b cabled to one NS224 shelf]
