[.lead]
After you install your AFF A20, AFF A30, or AFF A50 storage system hardware, cable the controllers to the network and shelves.

.Before you begin

Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the storage system to your network switches.

.About this task
* The cluster/HA and host network cabling procedures show common configurations. Keep in mind that the specific cabling depends on the components ordered for your storage system. For comprehensive configuration and slot priority details, see link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^].

* The cabling graphics have arrow icons showing the proper orientation (up or down) of the cable connector pull-tab when inserting a connector into a port.
+
As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it over and try again.

* If cabling to an optical switch, insert the optical transceiver into the controller port before cabling to the switch port.


== Step 1: Cable the cluster/HA connections
Cable the controllers to your ONTAP cluster. This procedure differs depending on your storage system model and I/O module configuration.

.. Cable controller A port e2a to controller B port e2a.
.. Cable controller A port e4a to controller B port e4a.
+
NOTE: Ports e2b and e4b on the I/O modules in slots 2 and 4 are unused and available for front-end (host network) connectivity, if needed.

== Step 4: Cable the shelf connections
This procedure show you how to cable the controllers to one NS224 shelf.

.About this task

* For the maximum number of shelves supported for your storage system and for all of your cabling options, such as optical and switch-attached, see link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^].

* You cable each controller to each NSM100B module on the NS224 shelf using the storage cables that came with your storage system, which could be the following cable type:
+
*100 GbE QSFP28 copper cables*
+
image::../media/oie_cable100_gbe_qsfp28.png[100 GbE QSFP28 copper cable,width=100px]
* The graphics show controller A cabling in blue and controller B cabling in yellow. 

.Steps

. Cable controller A to the shelf:
.. Cable controller A port e3a to NSM A port e1a.
.. Cable controller A port e3b to NSM B port e1b.
+
image:../media/drw_isi_g_1_ns224_controller_a_cabling_ieops-1945.svg[Controller A ports e3a and e3b cabled to one NS224 shelf]
