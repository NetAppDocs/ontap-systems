The AFF A20, AFF A30, and AFF A50 storage systems offer flexibility in expanding or replacing I/O modules to enhance network connectivity and performance. Adding, hot-swapping, or replacing an I/O module is essential when upgrading network capabilities or addressing a failed module.

You can replace a failed I/O module in your storage system with the same type of I/O module, or with a different type of I/O module. You can hot-swap a cluster and HA I/O module when your storage system meets specific requirements. You can also add an I/O module to a storage system with available slots.

Adding additional I/O modules can improve redundancy, helping to ensure that the storage system remains operational even if one I/O module fails.

+
Hot-swapping a failed cluster and HA I/O module can restore the storage system to its optimal operating state. Hot-swapping is done without having to manually take over the impaired controller.
+
To use this procedure, your storage system must be running ONTAP 9.17.1 or later and meet specific storage system requirements.

Replacing a failing I/O module can restore the storage system to its optimal operating state.
