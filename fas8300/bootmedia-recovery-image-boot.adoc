After installing the new boot media device in your system, you can boot the recovery image from a USB drive and restore the configuration from the partner node.

If your storage system is running ONTAP 9.17.1 or later, use the link:bootmedia-replace-workflow-bmr.html[automated boot recovery procedure]. If your system is running an earlier version of ONTAP, you must use the manual boot recovery procedure.
