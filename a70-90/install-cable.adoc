[.lead]
After you install the rack hardware for your AFF A70 or AFF A90 storage system, install the network cables for the controllers, and connect the cables between the controllers and storage shelves.

.Before you begin
Check the illustration arrow in the cabling diagrams for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.

image::../media/drw_cable_pull_tab_direction_ieops-1699.svg[Cable pull tab orientation example]

* As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn the cable head over and try again.
* If connecting to an optical switch, insert the small form-factor pluggable (SFP) transceiver into the controller port before cabling to the port.


== Step 1: Connect the storage controllers to your network
Connect the storage controllers to your host network.

.Before you begin

Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the storage system to the switches.

.About this task
These procedures show common configurations. Keep in mind that the specific cabling depends on the components ordered for your storage system. For comprehensive configuration and slot priority details, see link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^].

.Option 1: Connect the controllers to a switchless ONTAP cluster
--
Connect your storage controllers to each other to create the ONTAP cluster connections, and then connect the Ethernet ports on each controller to your host network.

.Steps

. Use the the Cluster/HA interconnect cable to connect to connect ports e1a to e1a and ports e7a to e7a. 

+
NOTE: The cluster interconnect traffic and the HA traffic share the same physical ports.

+
.. Connect port e1a on Controller A to port e1A on Controller B.
.. Connect port e7a on Controller A to port e1A on Controller B.

+
. Connect the Ethernet module ports to your host network. 
+
The following are some typical host network cabling examples. See  link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for your specific system configuration.

.. Connect ports e9a and e9b to your Ethernet data network switch as shown.
+
NOTE: For maximum system performance for cluster and HA traffic, do not use ports e1b and e7b ports for host network connections.  Use a separate host card to maximize performance.

.Option 2: Connect the controllers to a switched ONTAP cluster
--
Connect your storage controllers to the cluster network switches to create the ONTAP cluster connections, and then connect the Ethernet ports on each controller to your host network.

.Steps

. Make the following cabling connections:

+
NOTE: The cluster interconnect traffic and the HA traffic share the same physical ports.


+
.. Connect port e1a on Controller A and port e1a on Controller B to cluster network switch A. 
.. Connect port e7a on Controller A and port e7a on Controller B to cluster network switch B.

. Connect the Ethernet module ports to your host network. 
+
The following are some typical host network cabling examples. See  link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for your specific system configuration.

.. Connect ports e9a and e9b to your Ethernet data network switch as shown.
+
NOTE: For maximum system performance for cluster and HA traffic, do not use ports e1b and e7b ports for host network connections.  Use a separate host card to maximize performance.
