When reversing the system cabinet door, you must move the system cabinet door hinge and lock catch to the opposite front-side system cabinet upright.

You need the following tools:

* Phillips screwdriver
* 5 mm Allen wrench; magnetic Allen wrench is recommended
* Needle-nose pliers
* Step ladder so that you can easily access the Allen screws in the top hinge

. Remove the screws securing the top hinge from the system cabinet frame, and set the screws and hinge aside.
+
NOTE: Be careful when removing the Allen screws to avoid dropping them into the cabinet frame. Spare Allen screws are provided in the spares kit that shipped with your system cabinet.

. Remove the screws securing the bottom hinge from the system cabinet frame, and set the screws and hinge aside.

Make sure that you push the retaining clip completely onto the hinge pin.
