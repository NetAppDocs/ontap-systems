The manual recovery of the boot image involves using a USB drive to reinstall ONTAP onto the AFF A1K system's replacement boot media. You must download the appropriate ONTAP recovery image from the NetApp Support Site and copy it to a USB drive. This prepared USB drive is then used to perform the recovery and restore the system to operational status.

If your system is running in ONTAP 9.17.1 and later, use the link:bootmedia-replace-workflow-bmr.html[automatic boot recovery procedure].

To get started, review the recovery requirements, shut down the controller, replace the boot media, use the USB drive to restore the image, and reapply encryption settings if necessary.
