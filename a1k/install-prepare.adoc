Prepare to install your AFF A1K platform.

.Before you begin
* Use the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/software_setup/index.html[cluster setup worksheet] to record the values that you need when you link:complete-install.html#step-3-configure-your-cluster[configure your cluster].  If a default value is provided, you can use that value or else enter your own.

* Confirm you have all of the additional equipment and tools that you need to complete the hardware installation.

** Phillips #2 screwdriver 
** Flashlight
** ESD strap 
** A paperclip or narrow tipped ball point pen for setting NS224 shelf IDs
** Laptop or console with a USB/serial connection
** Access to a Web browser to configure your storage system
* You should be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the platform.
+
A fully loaded A1K platform can weigh up to 62.83 lbs (28.5 kg) and requires two people to lift or use a hydraulic lift.

* You should be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the shelf.
+
A fully loaded shelf can weigh up to 66.78 lbs (30.29 kg) and requires two people to lift or use a hydraulic lift. Avoid removing shelf components (from the front or rear of the shelf) to reduce the shelf weight, because shelf weight will become unbalanced.

* Airflow through the storage system enters from the front where the bezel or end caps are installed and exhausts out the rear where the ports are located.



== Step 1: Prepare the site
Make sure that the site and the cabinet or rack you plan to use meet the specifications for your storage system.

.Steps

. Confirm that your site meets the environmental and electrical requirements for your platform as shown in the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^].

. Make sure you have adequate rack space:
** 4U in an HA configuration for the platform 
** 2U for each NS224 shelf

. Install any required network switches near the platform.
+

See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-switches/index.html[Switch documentation] for installation instructions and link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for compatibility information.


== Step 2: Unpack the boxes
Unpack all boxes and compare the contents to the items on the packing slip.

. Carefully open all the boxes and lay out the contents in an organized manner.

. Compare the contents youâ€™ve unpacked with the list on the packing slip. 

+
NOTE: You can get your packing list by scanning the QR code on the side of the shipping carton.

+
The following items are some of the contents you might see in the boxes. 
+
Ensure that everything in the boxes matches the list on the packing slip. If there are any discrepancies, note them down for further action.
