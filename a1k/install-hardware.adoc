A cabinet or rack can be delivered with storage controllers and drive shelves pre-installed or completely empty. The following instructions describe how to install the hardware in an empty cabinet or rack. 

Remember that these instructions represent one approach. Always adapt the process to meet your specific site requirements for a successful installation.

.Before you begin
* Review the Safety Notices document included in the box, and understand the precautions for moving and installing hardware.

* You have the instructions packaged with the rail kit.

You can find the number on the packing slip, in your confirmation email, or on the controller after you unpack it.

== Step 2: Install the rail kit
If your hardware was shipped separately (not already installed in the cabinet or rack), you will need to install support rails in the cabinet or rack.
The AFF A1K storage system can only be mounted in four-post racks or cabinets using one of the following rack mount kits:

* link:../platform-supplemental/superrail-install.html[SuperRail kit] for universal use in third-party cabinets 
*  link:../platform-supplemental/42u-1280mm-install-additional-rails.html[NetApp-specific rail kit] designed for the NetApp 1280mm cabinet

Follow the instructions packaged with your the rail kit to install the rails in your cabinet or rack.

== Step 3: Install the hardware
If your cabinet or rack was delivered empty, use these steps to install your hardware. Skip this step if your cabinet or rack is pre-populated.

NOTE: A fully loaded NS224 drive shelf can weigh up to 66.78 lbs (30.29 kg) and requires two people to lift or use a hydraulic lift. Avoid removing shelf components (from the front or rear of the shelf) to reduce the shelf weight, because shelf weight will become unbalanced.

.Steps

. Install the storage system in the middle of the cabinet or rack.
+
.. Position the back of the storage system onto the rails, and then support the system from the bottom and slide it into the cabinet or rack.

.. Secure the storage system to the cabinet or rack using the included mounting screws.
+
. Install the shelf.
+

.. Position the back of the shelf onto the rails, and then support the shelf from the bottom and slide it into the cabinet or rack.
+
If you are installing multiple shelves, place the first drive shelf directly above the controllers. Place the second drive shelf directly under the controllers. Repeat this pattern for any additional drive shelves.


.. Secure the shelf to the cabinet or rack using the included mounting screws.
+
. Attach the cable management devices to the rear of the storage system.
