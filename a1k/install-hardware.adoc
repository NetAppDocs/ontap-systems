A cabinet or rack may have storage controllers and drive shelves pre-installed or completely empty. The following instructions describe how to install the hardware in an empty cabinet or rack. 

Always adapt the process to meet your specific site requirements for a successful installation.

.Before you begin
* Review the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMP12475945[Safety Notices] document, and understand the precautions for moving and installing hardware.

* You have the instructions packaged with the rail kit.


== Step 1: Install the rail kit
If your hardware was shipped separately (not already installed in the cabinet or rack), you will need to install support rails in the cabinet or rack.
The AFF A1K storage system can only be mounted in four-post racks or cabinets using one of the following rack mount kits:

* link:../platform-supplemental/superrail-install.html[SuperRail kit] for universal use in third-party cabinets or racks
*  link:../platform-supplemental/42u-1280mm-install-additional-rails.html[NetApp-specific rail kit] designed for the NetApp 1280mm cabinet

Follow the instructions packaged with your the rail kit to install the rails in your cabinet or rack.

== Step 2: Install the storage system and drive shelf
If your cabinet or rack is empty, use these steps to install your storage system and drive shelf. Skip this step if your cabinet or rack is pre-populated.

NOTE: A fully loaded NS224 drive shelf can weigh up to 66.78 lbs (30.29 kg) and requires two people to lift or use a hydraulic lift. Avoid removing shelf components (from the front or rear of the shelf) to reduce the shelf weight, because shelf weight will become unbalanced.

NOTE: Airflow through the storage system and shelves enters from the front where the bezel or end caps are installed and exhausts out the rear where the ports are located.
