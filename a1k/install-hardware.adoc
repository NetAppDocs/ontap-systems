You install a set of rails for the hardware in your cabinet or rack, and then slide the hardware onto the rails.

.Before you begin
* You have reviewed the Safety Notices document included in the box, and understand the precautions for moving and installing hardware.

* You have the instructions packaged with the rail kit.

* You understand that you should install hardware from the bottom of the cabinet or rack up to the top to prevent the equipment from tipping over.


== Step 1: Register your hardware
Registering your storage system provides support benefits.

.Steps

. Locate the serial number for your storage system. 
+
You can find the number on the packing slip, in your confirmation email, or on the controller after you unpack it.

== Step 2: Install the rail kit
The AFF A1K storage system can only be mounted in four-post racks or cabinets using one of the following rack mount kits:

* SuperRail kit for universal use in third-party cabinets
* NetApp-specific rail kits:
** Four-post thin fixed rail kit for the NetApp 1280mm cabinet (Ozeki)
** Four-post thin rail kit for third-party cabinets

.Option 1: Install the SuperRail kit
The SuperRail kit is designed for universal use and can be installed on either a standard square-hole four-post rack or a standard round-hole four-post rack.
It includes round-to-square hole adapter brackets for flexibility.

NetApp offers specific rail kits tailored for their own cabinets.
For the AFF A1K series, there are two relevant rail kits:

* X87881A: Supports 1280mm NetApp four-post cabinet fixed rails (thin rail)
* X5532A: Supports third-party four-post cabinets (thin rail)

If your equipment mounting flanges extend beyond the screw holes in the support rail, install cage nuts above the support rail, where needed.

== Step 3: Install the hardware
A cabinet or rack can be delivered either with storage controllers and disk shelves pre-installed or completely empty. The following instructions describe how to install the hardware in an empty cabinet or rack. You can skip this step if your cabinet or rack is pre-populated.

Remember that these instructions represent one approach. Always adapt the process to meet your specific site requirements for a successful installation.

.Steps

. Install the storage system in the middle of the cabinet or rack.
+
.. Position the back of the storage system onto the rails, and then support the system from the bottom and slide it into the cabinet or rack.

.. Secure the storage system to the cabinet or rack using the included mounting screws.
+
. Install the shelf.
+
If you are installing multiple shelves, place the first drive shelf directly above the controllers. Place the second drive shelf directly under the controllers. Repeat this pattern for any additional drive shelves.

.. Position the back of the shelf onto the rails, and then support the shelf from the bottom and slide it into the cabinet or rack.

.. Secure the shelf to the cabinet or rack using the included mounting screws.
+
. Attach the cable management devices to the rear of the storage system.

. Attach the bezel to the front of the storage system.
