== Step 3: Install the hardware
A cabinet or rack can be delivered either with storage controllers and disk shelves pre-installed or completely empty. The following instructions describe how to install the hardware in an empty cabinet or rack. You can skip this step if your cabinet or rack is pre-populated.

Remember that these instructions represent one approach. Always adapt the process to meet your specific site requirements for a successful installation.

.Steps

. Install the storage system in the middle of the cabinet or rack.
+
.. Position the back of the storage system onto the rails, and then support the system from the bottom and slide it into the cabinet or rack.

.. Secure the storage system to the cabinet or rack using the included mounting screws.
+
. Install the shelf.
+
If you are installing multiple shelves, place the first drive shelf directly above the controllers. Place the second drive shelf directly under the controllers. Repeat this pattern for any additional drive shelves.

.. Position the back of the shelf onto the rails, and then support the shelf from the bottom and slide it into the cabinet or rack.

.. Secure the shelf to the cabinet or rack using the included mounting screws.
+
. Attach the cable management devices to the rear of the storage system.
