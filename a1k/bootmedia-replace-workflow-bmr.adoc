[.lead]
Boot media recovery for your AFF A1K storage system uses the boot image from the partner node and automatically runs the appropriate boot menu option to install the boot image on your replacement boot media.

Get started with replacing the boot media in your AFF A1K storage system by reviewing the replacement requirements, shutting down the controller, replacing the boot media, restoring the image on the boot media, and verifying the system functionality.
