System Manager provides a simple and easy workflow for setting up a new cluster and configuring your storage.

== Step 1: Gather cluster information
Gather the information you will need to configure your cluster, such as your cluster management interface port and IP address. 

Use the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/software_setup/index.html[cluster setup worksheet] to record the values that you need during the cluster setup process. If a default value is provided, you can use that value or else enter your own.

== Step 2: Discover your cluster network
Discover your cluster with only a connection to the switch and laptop, or by connecting directly to a controller in the system and then connecting to the management switch.

If you have network discovery enabled on your laptop, you can complete system setup and configuration using automatic cluster discovery.

.Steps
. Connect your laptop to the management switch and access the network computers and devices.

. Select an ONTAP icon listed to discover:

 .. Open File Explorer.
 .. Click *Network* in the left pane.
 .. Right-click and select *refresh*.
 .. Double-click either ONTAP icon and accept any certificates displayed on your screen.

.Option 2: Network discovery is not enabled
--
If network discovery is not enabled on your laptop, complete the configuration and setup using this task.

.Before you begin
Make sure your laptop is connected to the serial console port and the controllers are powered on. See link:power-hardware.html#step-2-power-on-the-controllers[Power on the controllers] for instructions.

.Steps

Assign an initial node management IP address to one of the nodes.

== Step 3: Configure your cluster
Use System Manager to configure your cluster. For instructions, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_configure_ontap.html[Configure ONTAP on a new cluster with System Manager].

System Manager provides a simple and easy workflow for cluster set up and configuration including assigning a node management IP address, initializing the cluster, creating a local tier, configuring protocols and provisioning initial storage.
