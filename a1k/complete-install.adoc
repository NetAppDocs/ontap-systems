System Manager provides a simple and easy workflow for setting up a new cluster and configuring your storage.

== Step 1: Gather cluster information
Gather the information you will need to configure your cluster, such as your cluster management interface port and IP address. 

Use the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/software_setup/index.html[cluster setup worksheet] to record the values that you need during the cluster setup process. If a default value is provided, you can use that value or else enter your own.

== Step 2: Discover your cluster network
Discover your cluster with only a connection to the switch and laptop, or by connecting directly to a controller in the system and then connecting to the management switch.

 .. Open File Explorer.
 .. Click *Network* in the left pane.
 .. Right-click and select *refresh*.
 .. Double-click either ONTAP icon and accept any certificates displayed on your screen.
+
NOTE: XXXXX is the system serial number for the target node.
+
System Manager opens.

.Option 2: Network discovery is not enabled
--
If network discovery is not enabled on your laptop, you must complete the configuration and setup using this task.

.Steps
. Cable and configure your laptop or console:
 .. Set the console port on the laptop or console to 115,200 baud with N-8-1.
+
NOTE: See your laptop or console's online help for instructions on how to configure the console port.

 .. Connect the console cable to the laptop or console, and connect the console port on the controller using the console cable that came with your system.

 .. Assign a TCP/IP address to the laptop or console, using one that is on the management subnet.
. Plug the power cords into the controller power supplies, and then connect them to power sources on different circuits.
+
The system begins to boot. Initial booting may take up to eight minutes.

. Assign an initial node management IP address to one of the nodes.

== Step 3: Configure your cluster
Use System Manager to configure your cluster. For instructions, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_configure_ontap.html[Configure ONTAP on a new cluster with System Manager]

System Manager provides a simple and easy workflow for cluster set up and configuration including assigning a node management IP address, initializing the cluster, creating a local tier, configuring protocols and provisioning initial storage.
