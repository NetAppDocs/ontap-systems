Shut down the impaired controller in your AFF A1K storage system to prevent data loss and maintain system stability during the automated boot media recovery process.

If your storage system is running ONTAP 9.17.1 or later, use the link:bootmedia-replace-workflow-bmr.html[automated boot recovery procedure]. If your system is running an earlier version of ONTAP, you must use the manual boot recovery procedure.
