To install hardware, install the rail kits for your platform and shelves, and then install and secure your platform in the cabinet or telco rack. Next, slide the shelves onto the rails. Finally, attach cable management devices to the rear of the platform for organized cable routing.

To complete system setup, access the web-based interface, System Manager, by pointing a browser to the controller's IP address. A setup wizard helps you get started with cluster configuration. As an alternative, you can also use the command line interface (CLI).
