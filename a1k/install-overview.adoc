To install and set up your AFF A1K system, you review installation requirements, prepare your site, install and cable the hardware components, power on the system, and configure the ONTAP cluster.

.Before you begin
Before installing your system, familiarize yourself with the system requirements, workflow, and processes outlined in this Overview.

To prepare for install, you need to get the site ready, check the environmental and electrical requirements, and ensure there’s enough rack space. Then, unpack the equipment, compare its contents to the packing slip, and register the hardware to access support benefits.

To install the hardware, install the rail kits for your storage system and shelves, and then install and secure your storage system in the cabinet or telco rack. Next, slide the shelves onto the rails. Finally, attach cable management devices to the rear of the storage system for organized cable routing.

Before you power on the controllers, power on each NS224 shelf and assign a unique shelf ID to ensure each shelf is uniquely identified within the setup.
