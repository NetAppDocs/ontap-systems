Replace the real-time clock (RTC) battery, commonly known as a coin cell battery, in your ASA A70 or ASA A90 system to ensure that services and applications relying on accurate time synchronization remain operational.

You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your system.

Make sure all other components in the system are functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.
