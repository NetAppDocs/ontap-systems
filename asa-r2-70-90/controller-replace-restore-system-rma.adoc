To complete the controller replacement for your ASA A70 or ASA A90 system, first restore the NetApp Storage Encryption configuration (if necessary). Next, confirm that the logical interfaces (LIFs) are reporting to their home ports and perform a cluster health check. Finally, return the failed part to NetApp.
