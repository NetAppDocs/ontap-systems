This section gives detailed step-by-step instructions for installing a AFF C190 system.

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

To install your AFF C190 system, create an account and register the system. You also need to inventory the appropriate number and type of cables for your system and collect specific network information.

.Before you begin
* Make sure you have access to link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] (HWU) for information about site requirements as well as additional information on your configured system. 
* Make sure you have access to the link:http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[Release Notes^]  for your version of ONTAP for more information about this system.
* Make sure you have the following items at your site:
** Rack space for the storage system
** Phillips #2 screwdriver
** Additional networking cables to connect your system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser
** A laptop or console with an RJ-45 connection and access to a Web browser

.Steps
. Unpack the contents of all boxes.
. Record the system serial number from the controllers.

+
image::../media/drw_cable_management_arm_install.png[]

. Place the bezel on the front of the system.

== Step 3: Cable controllers to your network

Cable the controllers to your network by using the two-node switchless cluster method or the cluster interconnect network method.

The following table identifies the cable type with the call out number and cable color in the illustrations for both two-node switchless cluster network cabling and switched cluster network cabling.

.Before you begin
Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.png[]

NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

NOTE: If connecting to an optical switch, insert the SFP into the controller port before cabling to the port.

.About this task
Refer to the following cabling illustrations when cabling between the controllers and the switches.
