Restore the NetApp Storage Encryption configuration (if necessary), install licenses for the replacement controller, verify that the logical interfaces (LIFs) are reporting to their home port, perform a cluster health check, register the replacement controller's serial number, and then return the failed part to NetApp to complete the final step in the FAS50 controller replacement procedure.
