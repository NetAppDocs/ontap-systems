You can hot-swap an NVMe SSD caching module (Flash Cache module) of the same capacity from the same or different supported vendor.


.Before you begin

Your storage system must meet certain criteria depending on your situation:

* Your storage system must have the appropriate operating system for the caching module you are installing.
* The replacement caching module must have the same capacity as the failed caching module, but can be from a different supported vendor.
* All other components in the storage system must be functioning properly; if not, contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] before continuing.

.Steps
. Properly ground yourself.
. Locate the failed caching module by the lit amber Attention LED on the front of the caching module.
+
A caching module can be in drive bay 0 or 23.

. Remove the caching module:

Slide the module out of the drive bay using the cam handle and supporting the module with your other hand. 

When removing a module, always use two hands to support its weight.

|===

. Wait a minimum of 70 seconds before inserting the replacement caching module.
. Install the replacement caching module:
 .. With the cam handle in the open position, use both hands to insert the module.
.. Gently push until the module stops.
.. Close the cam handle so that the module is fully seated into the midplane and the handle clicks into place.
+
Be sure to close the cam handle slowly so that it aligns correctly with the face of the module.
. Verify that the module's activity (green) LED is illuminated.
