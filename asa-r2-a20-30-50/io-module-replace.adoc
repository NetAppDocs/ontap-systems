[.lead]
Replace an I/O module in your ASA A20, ASA A30, or ASA A50 system when the module fails or requires an upgrade to support higher performance or additional features. The replacement process involves shutting down the controller, replacing the failed I/O module, rebooting the controller, and returning the failed part to NetApp.
