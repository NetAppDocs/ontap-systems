Replace the NV battery in your ASA A20, ASA A30, or ASA A50 system when the battery begins to lose charge or fails, as it is responsible for preserving critical system data during power outages. The replacement process involves shutting down the impaired controller, removing the controller module, replacing the NV battery, reinstalling the controller module, and returning the failed part to NetApp.
