[.lead]
Add an I/O module to your ASA A20, ASA A30, or ASA A50 system to enhance network connectivity and expand your systemâ€™s ability to handle data traffic.

You can add an I/O module to your ASA A20, ASA A30, and ASA A50 storage systems when there are slots available or when all slots are fully populated.

.About this task

If needed, you can turn on the storage system location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the asaected storage system. Log into the BMC using SSH and enter the `system location-led _on_` command.

A storage system has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each controller. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. 

You can turn them off by entering the `system location-led _off_` command. If you are unsure if the LEDs are on or off, you can check their state by entering the `system location-led show` command.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller module
