Learn how to install your ASA A150 system.

If you have a MetroCluster configuration, use the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/index.html[MetroCluster documentation^].

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

To install your system, create an account on the NetApp Support Site, register your system, and obtain your license keys. You also need to inventory the appropriate number and type of cables for your system and collect specific network information.

.Before you begin
* Make sure you have access to link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] (HWU) for information about site requirements as well as additional information on your configured system. 
* Make sure you have access to the link:http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[Release Notes^]  for your version of ONTAP for more information about this system.
* Contact your network administrator for information about connecting your system to the switches.
* Make sure you have the following items at your site:
** Rack space for the storage system
** Phillips #2 screwdriver
** Additional networking cables to connect your system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser
** A laptop or console with an RJ-45 connection and access to a Web browser

.Steps
. Unpack the contents of all boxes.
. Record the system serial number from the controllers.

== Step 2: Install the hardware

Install your system in a 4-post rack or NetApp system cabinet, as applicable.

.Steps
. Install the rail kits, as needed.
. Install and secure your system using the instructions included with the rail kit.
+
NOTE: You need to be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the system.
+
image::../media/drw_oie_fas2700_weight_caution.png[]

. Attach cable management devices (as shown).
+
image::../media/drw_cable_management_arm_install.png[]

. Place the bezel on the front of the system.

== Step 3: Cable controllers to network

Cable the controllers to your network by using either the two-node switchless cluster method or the cluster interconnect network method.

Management network, UTA2 data network, Ethernet data network, and management ports on the controllers are connected to switches. The cluster interconnect ports are cabled on both controllers.

.Before you begin 
Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.png[]

NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

.About this task
You can use either the UTA2 data network ports or the ethernet data network ports  to connect the controllers to your host network. Refer to the following cabling illustrations when cabling between the controllers and the switches.

[horizontal]
UTA2 data network configurations:: 
Use one of the following cable types to cable the UTA2 data ports to your host network. 
+
* For an FC host, use 0c and 0d *or* 0e and 0f.
* For an 10GbE system, use e0c and e0d *or* e0e and e0f. 
+
image:../media/drw_c190_u_fc_10gbe_cbling.png[Illustration showing the data port connections as described in the surrounding text]

== Step 4: Cable controllers to drive shelves
Cable the controllers to your shelves using the onboard storage ports. NetApp recommends MP-HA cabling for systems with external storage. 

.About this task
If you have a SAS tape drive, you can use single-path cabling. If you have no external shelves, MP-HA cabling to internal drives is optional (not shown) if the SAS cables are ordered with the system.

You must cable the shelf-to-shelf connections, and then cable both controllers to the drive shelves.

Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.png[]

.Steps
. Cable the HA pair with external drive shelves.
+
The following example shows cabling for DS224C drive shelves. The cabling is similar with other supported drive shelves.
+
image::../media/drw_a150_ha_storage_cabling_IEOPS-1032.svg[width=440px]
+
. Cable the shelf-to-shelf ports.

 ** Port 3 on IOM A to port 1 on the IOM A on the shelf directly below.
 ** Port 3 on IOM B to port 1 on the IOM B on the shelf directly below.
+
image:../media/oie_cable_mini_sas_hd_to_mini_sas_hd.png[]     mini-SAS HD to mini-SAS HD cables

. Connect each node to IOM A in the stack.

 ** Controller 1 port 0b to IOM A port 3 on last drive shelf in the stack.
 ** Controller 2 port 0a to IOM A port 1 on the first drive shelf in the stack.
+
image:../media/oie_cable_mini_sas_hd_to_mini_sas_hd.png[]     mini-SAS HD to mini-SAS HD cables
+
. Connect each node to IOM B in the stack

 ** Controller 1 port 0a to IOM B port 1 on first drive shelf in the stack.
 ** Controller 2 port 0b to IOM B port 3 on the last drive shelf in the stack.
 image:../media/oie_cable_mini_sas_hd_to_mini_sas_hd.png[]     mini-SAS HD to mini-SAS HD cables

If you have more than one drive shelf stack, see link:../com.netapp.doc.hw-ds-sas3-icg/home.html[Installing and cabling] for your drive shelf type.

== Step 5: Complete system setup

You can complete the system setup and configuration using cluster discovery with only a connection to the switch and laptop, or by connecting directly to a controller in the system and then connecting to the management switch.

// start tabbed area
