This procedure gives detailed step-by-step instructions for installing an AFF C250 storage system.

If you have a MetroCluster configuration, use the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/index.html[MetroCluster Documentation^].

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

To install your AFF C250 system, you need to create an account and register the system. You also need to inventory the appropriate number and type of cables for your system and collect specific network information. 

.Before you begin
* Make sure you have access to the link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] (HWU) for information about site requirements. 
* Customers with specific power requirements must check https://hwu.netapp.com[HWU] for configuration options.
* Make sure you have access to the link:http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[Release Notes for your version of ONTAP^] for more information about this system.
* You need to provide the following at your site:

** Rack space for the storage system
** Phillips #2 screwdriver
** Additional networking cables to connect your system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser.

.Steps
. Unpack the contents of all boxes.
. Record the system serial number from the controllers.
+

. Set up your account:
 .. Log in to your existing account or create an account.
 .. Register (link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/eservice/registerSNoAction.do?moduleName=RegisterMyProduct[NetApp Product Registration^]) your system.
. Download and install link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[NetApp Downloads: Config Advisor^] on your laptop.
. Inventory and make a note of the number and types of cables you received.
+
The following table identifies the types of cables you might receive. If you receive a cable not listed in the table, see the link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] to locate the cable and identify its use.

Powering up the system
|===

. Review the link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2862613[ONTAP Configuration Guide^] and collect the required information listed in that guide.

== Step 2: Install the hardware

You need to install your system in a 4-post rack or NetApp system cabinet, as applicable.

.Steps
. Install the rail kits, as needed.
. Install and secure your system using the instructions included with the rail kit.
+
NOTE: You need to be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the system.
+
image::../media/drw_affa250_weight_caution.png[]

. Identify and manage cables because this system does not have a cable management device.
. Place the bezel on the front of the system.

== Step 3: Cable controllers to cluster

Cable the controllers to a cluster by using the two-node switchless cluster method or by using the cluster interconnect network.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Option 1: Two-node switchless cluster
--
The management, Fibre Channel, and data or host network ports on the controller modules are connected to switches. The cluster interconnect ports are cabled on both controller modules.

.Before you begin
* Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

* Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.
+
image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.png[]
+
NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

.About this task
Use the animation or the tabulated steps to complete the cabling between the controllers and the switches. Perform the steps on each controller.

video::beec3966-0a01-473c-a5de-ac68017fbf29[panopto, title="Animation - Cable a two-node switchless cluster"]

.Steps
. Cable the cluster interconnect ports e0c to e0c and e0d to e0 with the 25GbE cluster interconnect cableimage:../media/oie_cable_sfp_gbe_copper.png[]:
+
image:../media/drw_affa250_tnsc_cabling.png[]

. Cable the wrench ports to the management network switches with the RJ45 cables.
+
image::../media/drw_affa250_mgmt_cabling.png[]

IMPORTANT: DO NOT plug in the power cords at this point.
--

.Option 2: Switched cluster
--
All ports on the controllers are connected to switches; cluster interconnect, management, Fibre Channel, and data or host network switches.

.Before you begin
* Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

* Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.

== Step 4: Cable to host network or storage (Optional)

You have configuration-dependent optional cabling to the Fibre Channel or iSCSI host networks or direct-attached storage. This cabling is not exclusive; you can have cabling to a host network and storage.

NOTE: link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] slot priority for host network cards (Fibre Channel or 25GbE) is slot 2. However, if you have both cards, the Fibre Channel card goes in slot 2 and the 25GbE card goes in slot 1 (as shown in the options below). If you have an external shelf, the storage card goes in slot 1, the only supported slot for shelves.

== Step 5: Complete system setup

Complete the system setup and configuration using cluster discovery with only a connection to the switch and laptop, or by connecting directly to a controller in the system and then connecting to the management switch.

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Option 1: If network discovery is enabled
--
If you have network discovery enabled on your laptop, you can complete system setup and configuration using automatic cluster discovery.

.Steps
. Use the following animation to power on and set shelf IDs for one or more drive shelves:
+
For NS224 drive shelves, shelf IDs are pre-set to 00 and 01. If you want to change the shelf IDs, use the straightened end of a paperclip, or narrow tipped ball point pen to access the shelf ID button behind the faceplate.
+
video::c500e747-30f8-4763-9065-afbf00008e7f[panopto, title="Animation - Set drive shelf IDs"]

. Plug the power cords into the controller power supplies, and then connect them to power sources on different circuits.
+
The system begins to boot. Initial booting may take up to eight minutes.

. Make sure that your laptop has network discovery enabled.
+
See your laptop's online help for more information.

. Connect your laptop to the Management switch:
