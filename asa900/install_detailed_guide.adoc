This page provides detailed step-by-step instructions for installing a typical NetApp system. Use this article if you want more detailed installation instructions.

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

To install your system, you need to create an account on the NetApp Support Site, register your system, and get license keys. You also need to inventory the appropriate number and type of cables for your system and collect specific network information.

You need to have access to the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for information about site requirements as well as additional information on your configured system.

.What you need
You might also want to have access to the http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[ONTAP 9 Release Notes^] for your version of ONTAP for more information about this system.

You need to provide the following at your site:

* Rack space for the storage system
* Phillips #2 screwdriver
* Additional networking cables to connect your system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser

.Steps
. Unpack the contents of all boxes.
. Record the system serial number from the controllers.
+

. Inventory and make a note of the number and types of cables you received.
+
The following table identifies the types of cables you might receive. If you receive a cable not listed in the table, see the Hardware Universe to locate the cable and identify its use.

Powering up the system
|===

. Review the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2862613[ONTAP Configuration Guide^] and collect the required information listed in that guide.

== Step 2: Install the hardware

You need to install your system in a 4-post rack or NetApp system cabinet, as applicable.

. Install the rail kits, as needed.
. Install and secure your system using the instructions included with the rail kit.
+
NOTE: You need to be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the system.
+
image::../media/drw_9500_lifting_icon.svg[Weight lifting caution label]

. Attach cable management devices (as shown).
+
image::../media/drw_9500_cable_management_arms.svg[Lifting handles and cable management device]

. Place the bezel on the front of the system.

The following diagram shows a representation of what a typical system looks like and where the major components are located at the rear of the system:

image::../media/drw_a900_controller_in_chassis_ID_IEOPS-856.svg[Typical cluster configuration]

== Step 3: Cable controllers to your network

You can cable the controllers to your network by using the two-node switchless cluster method or by using the cluster interconnect network.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Option 1: Two-node switchless cluster
--

Management network, data network, and management ports on the controllers are connected to switches. The cluster interconnect ports are cabled on both controllers.

.Before you begin

You must have contacted your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

Be sure to check the direction of the cable pull-tabs when inserting the cables in the ports. Cable pull-tabs are up for all networking module ports.

image:../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_up.png[Cable pull tab direction]

NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

. Use the animation or illustration to complete the cabling between the controllers and to the switches:

.Option 2: Switched cluster
--

Management network, data network, and management ports on the controllers are connected to switches. The cluster interconnect and HA ports are cabled on to the cluster/HA switch.

.Before you begin

You must have contacted your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

Be sure to check the direction of the cable pull-tabs when inserting the cables in the ports. Cable pull-tabs are up for all networking module ports.

.Option 1: Cable the controllers to a single NS224 drive shelf
--

You must cable each controller to the NSM modules on the NS224 drive shelf.

.Before you begin

* Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation. The cable pull-tab for the storage modules are up, while the pull tabs on the shelves are down.

== Step 5: Complete system setup and configuration

You can complete the system setup and configuration using cluster discovery with only a connection to the switch and laptop, or by connecting directly to a controller in the system and then connecting to the management switch.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Option 1: If network discovery is enabled
--

If you have network discovery enabled on your laptop, you can complete system setup and configuration using automatic cluster discovery.

. Use the following animation or drawing  to set one or more drive shelf IDs:
+
The NS224 shelves are pre-set to shelf ID 00 and 01. If you want to change the shelf IDs, you must create a tool to insert into the hole where button is located. see link:../ns224/change-shelf-id.html[Change a shelf ID - NS224 shelves] for detailed instructions.
