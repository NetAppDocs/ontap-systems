This page gives detailed step-by-step instructions for installing an ASA A250 system.

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

To install your system, you need to create an account and register the system. You also need to inventory the appropriate number and type of cables for your system and collect specific network information.

NOTE: Customers with specific power requirements must check HWU for their configuration options.

.Before you begin
* Make sure you have access to the link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] (HWU) for information about site requirements. 
* Make sure you have access to the link:http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[Release Notes for your version of ONTAP^] for more information about this system.
* You need to provide the following at your site:

** Rack space for the storage system
** Phillips #2 screwdriver
** Additional networking cables to connect your system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser

.Steps
. Unpack the contents of all boxes.
. Record the system serial number from the controllers.

Powering up the system
|===

. Review the link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2862613[ONTAP Configuration Guide^] and collect the required information listed in that guide.

== Step 2: Install the hardware

You need to install your system in a 4-post rack or NetApp system cabinet, as applicable.

.Steps
. Install the rail kits, as needed.
. Install and secure your system using the instructions included with the rail kit.
+
NOTE: You need to be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the system.
+
image::../media/drw_affa250_weight_caution.png[]

. Identify and manage cables because this system does not have a cable management device.
. Place the bezel on the front of the system.

== Step 3: Cable controllers to cluster
Cable the controllers to a cluster by using the two-node switchless cluster method or by using the cluster interconnect network method.

* Contact your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

* Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.
+
image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.png[]
+
NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

.About this task
Use the animation or the tabulated steps to complete the cabling between the controllers and the switches. Perform the steps on each controller.

== Step 5: Complete system setup

Complete the system setup and configuration using cluster discovery with only a connection to the switch and laptop, or by connecting directly to a controller in the system and then connecting to the management switch.

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Option 1: If network discovery is enabled
--
If you have network discovery enabled on your laptop, you can complete system setup and configuration using automatic cluster discovery.

.Steps
. Plug the power cords into the controller power supplies, and then connect them to power sources on different circuits.
+
The system begins to boot. Initial booting may take up to eight minutes.

. Make sure that your laptop has network discovery enabled.
+
See your laptop's online help for more information.

. Use the animation to connect your laptop to the Management switch:
+
video::d61f983e-f911-4b76-8b3a-ab1b0066909b[panopto, title="Animation - Connect your laptop to the Management switch"]

. Select an ONTAP icon listed to discover:
+
image::../media/drw_autodiscovery_controler_select.png[]

 .. Open File Explorer.
 .. Click *Network* in the left pane.
 .. Right-click and select *refresh*.
 .. Double-click either ONTAP icon and accept any certificates displayed on your screen.
+
NOTE: XXXXX is the system serial number for the target node.

+
System Manager opens.
. Use System Manager guided setup to configure your system using the data you collected in the link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2862613[ONTAP Configuration Guide^].
. Verify the health of your system by running Config Advisor.

.Option 2: If network discovery is not enabled
--
If network discovery is not enabled on your laptop, you must complete the configuration and setup using this task.

.Steps
. Cable and configure your laptop or console:
 .. Set the console port on the laptop or console to 115,200 baud with N-8-1.
+
NOTE: See your laptop or console's online help for how to configure the console port.

 .. Connect the laptop or console to the switch on the management subnet.
+
image::../media/drw_console_client_mgmt_subnet_affa250.png[]

 .. Assign a TCP/IP address to the laptop or console, using one that is on the management subnet.
. Plug the power cords into the controller power supplies, and then connect them to power sources on different circuits.
+
The system begins to boot. Initial booting may take up to eight minutes.

. Assign an initial node management IP address to one of the nodes.
+

 .. Open a console session using PuTTY, a terminal server, or the equivalent for your environment.
+
NOTE: Check your laptop or console's online help if you do not know how to configure PuTTY.

 .. Enter the management IP address when prompted by the script.

+
|===

. Using System Manager on your laptop or console, configure your cluster:
 .. Point your browser to the node management IP address.
+
NOTE: The format for the address is +https://x.x.x.x+.

 .. Configure the system using the data you collected in the link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2862613[ONTAP Configuration Guide^].
+
