You must replace the caching module in the controller module when your system registers a single AutoSupport (ASUP) message that the module has gone offline; failure to do so results in performance degradation.

You might want to erase the contents of your caching module before replacing it.

* Although data on the caching module is encrypted, you might want to erase any data from the impaired caching module and verify that the caching module has no data:
** Erase the data on the caching module: `system controller flash-cache secure-erase run -node _node name_ localhost -device-id _device_number_`
+
NOTE: Run the `system controller flash-cache show` command if you don't know the flashcache device ID.
+
** Verify that the data has been erased from the caching module: `system controller flash-cache secure-erase show`
+

* You must replace the failed component with a replacement FRU component you received from your provider.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller

You can shut down or take over the impaired controller using different procedures, depending on the storage system hardware configuration.

== Step 2: Open the controller module

To access components inside the controller, you must first remove the controller module from the system and then remove the cover on the controller module.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables and SFPs (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.

. Remove and set aside the cable management devices from the left and right sides of the controller module.

. Loosen the thumbscrew on the cam handle on the controller module.

. Pull the cam handle downward and begin to slide the controller module out of the chassis.
+
Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the chassis.

== Step 3: Replace or add a caching module

To replace or add a caching module referred to as the M.2 PCIe card on the label on your controller, locate the slots inside the controller and follow the specific sequence of steps.

Your storage system must meet certain criteria depending on your situation:

* It must have the appropriate operating system for the caching module you are installing.
* It must support the caching capacity.
* All other components in the storage system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

. Locate the caching module at the rear of the controller module and remove it.
 .. Press the release tab.
 .. Remove the heatsink.
+
The storage system comes with two slots available for the caching module and only one slot is occupied, by default.
+

. If you are adding a caching module, go to the next step; if you are replacing the caching module, gently pull it straight out of the housing.
. Align the edges of the caching module with the socket in the housing, and then gently push it into the socket.
. Verify that the caching module is seated squarely and completely in the socket.
+
If necessary, remove the caching module and reseat it into the socket.

. Reseat and push the heatsink down to engage the locking button on the caching module housing.
. Repeat the steps if you have a second caching module. Close the controller module cover, as needed.

== Step 4: Reinstall the controller

After you replace a component within the controller module, you must reinstall the controller module in the system chassis.

. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Recable the system, as needed.
+
If you removed the media converters (QSFPs or SFPs), remember to reinstall them if you are using fiber optic cables.

. Complete the reinstallation of the controller module:
+
The controller module begins to boot as soon as it is fully seated in the chassis

 .. With the cam handle in the open position, firmly push the controller module in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated, and then close the cam handle to the locked position.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.

 .. Tighten the thumbscrew on the cam handle on back of the controller module.
 .. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
 .. Bind the cables to the cable management device with the hook and loop strap.
