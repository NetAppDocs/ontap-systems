[.lead]
You can add an I/O module to your system by either replacing a NIC or storage adapter with a new one in a fully-populated system, or by adding a new NIC or storage adapter into an empty chassis slot in your system.

.Before you begin
* Check the https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe] to make sure that the new I/O module is compatible with your system and version of ONTAP you're running.
* If multiple slots are available, check the slot priorities in https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe]  and use the best one available for your I/O module.
* To non-disruptively add an I/O module, you must take over the target controller, remove the slot blanking cover in the target slot or remove an existing I/O module, add the new or replacement I/O module, and then giveback the target controller.
* Make sure that all other components are functioning properly.


== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller module

Shut down or take over the impaired controller using one of the following options.

[role="tabbed-block"]

.Option 1: Most systems

include::../_include/shutdown_most_frus_no_PCM_remove.adoc[]
--
.Option 2: Controller is in a MetroCluster
--
include::../_include/shutdown_any_mcc_supported_no_PCM_remove.adoc[]
--

====

== Step 2: Add the new I/O modules
If the storage system has empty slots, install the new I/O module into one of the available slots. If all slots are occupied, remove an existing I/O module to make space and then install the new one.

.Add I/O module to an empty slot
--
You can add a new I/O module into a storage system with available empty slots.

.Steps

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Remove the target slot blanking cover:
.. Depress the lettered and numbered cam latch.
.. Rotate the cam latch down until it is the open position.
.. Remove the blanking cover.
. Install the I/O module:
.. Align the I/O module with the edges of the slot.
.. Slide the I/O module into the slot until the lettered and numbered I/O cam latch begins to engage with the I/O cam pin.
.. Push the I/O cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. If the replacement I/O module is a NIC, cable the module to the data switches.
+
NOTE: Make sure that any unused I/O slots have blanks installed to prevent possible thermal issues.

. Reboot the controller from the LOADER prompt: _bye_
+
NOTE: This reinitializes the PCIe cards and other components and reboots the node.

. Give back the node from the partner node. `storage failover giveback -ofnode target_node_name`
. Enable automatic giveback if it was disabled: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`
. If you are using slots 3 and/or 7 for networking, use the `storage port modify -node __<node name>__ -port __<port name>__ -mode network` command to convert the slot for networking use.
. Repeat these steps for controller B.
. If you installed a storage I/O module, install and cable your SAS shelves, as described in link:../sas3/install-hot-add-shelf.html[Hot-adding a SAS shelf].

.Add I/O module to a fully-populated system
--
You can add an I/O module to a fully-populated system by removing an existing I/O module and installing a new one in its place.

.About this task
Make sure you understand the following scenarios for adding a new I/O module to a fully-populated system:

[options="header" cols="1,2"]
|===
| Scenario| Action required
a|
NIC to NIC (same number of ports)
a|
The LIFs will automatically migrate when its controller module is shut down.
a|
NIC to NIC (different number of ports)	
a|
Permanently reassign the selected LIFs to a different home port. See https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.onc-sm-help-960/GUID-208BB0B8-3F84-466D-9F4F-6E1542A2BE7D.html[Migrating a LIF^] for more information.
a|
NIC to storage I/O module
a|
Use System Manager to permanently migrate the LIFs to different home ports, as described in https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.onc-sm-help-960/GUID-208BB0B8-3F84-466D-9F4F-6E1542A2BE7D.html[Migrating a LIF^].

.Steps

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug any cabling on the target I/O module.
. Remove the target I/O module from the chassis:
.. Depress the lettered and numbered cam latch.
+
The cam latch moves away from the chassis.
.. Rotate the cam latch down until it is in a horizontal position.
+
The I/O module disengages from the chassis and moves about 1/2 inch out of the I/O slot.
.. Remove the I/O module from the chassis by pulling on the pull tabs on the sides of the module face.
+
Make sure that you keep track of which slot the I/O module was in.

. Install the I/O module into the target slot:
.. Align the I/O module with the edges of the slot.
.. Slide the I/O module into the slot until the lettered and numbered I/O cam latch begins to engage with the I/O cam pin.
.. Push the I/O cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. Repeat the remove and install steps to replace additional modules for controller A.
. If the replacement I/O module is a NIC, cable the module or modules to the data switches.
+
NOTE: This reinitializes the PCIe cards and other components and reboots the node.
+
. Reboot the controller from the LOADER prompt:
.. Check the version of BMC on the controller: `system service-processor show`
.. Update the BMC firmware if needed: `system service-processor image update`
.. Reboot the node: `bye`
+
NOTE: This reinitializes the PCIe cards and other components and reboots the node.
+

NOTE: If you encounter an issue during reboot, see https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1494308[BURT 1494308 - Environment shutdown might be triggered during I/O module replacement ]


. Give back the node from the partner node. `storage failover giveback -ofnode target_node_name`
. Enable automatic giveback if it was disabled: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`

. If you added:
