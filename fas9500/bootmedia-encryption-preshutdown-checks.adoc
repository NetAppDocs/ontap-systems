To ensure data security on your storage system, you need to verify the encryption key support and status on your boot media. Check if your ONTAP version supports NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE), and before you shut down the controller check if the key manager is active. 

If your storage system is running ONTAP 9.17.1 or later, use the automated boot recovery procedure. If your system is running an earlier version of ONTAP, you must use the manual boot recovery process.
