[.lead]
You cable each NS224 shelf you are hot-adding so that each shelf has two connections to each controller in the HA pair.

When additional storage is needed, you can hot-add up to three additional NS224 drive shelves (for a total of four shelves) to an AFF A900 HA pair.

.Before you begin

* You must have reviewed the link:requirements-hot-add-shelf.html[hot-add requirements and best practices]. 

* You must have completed the applicable procedures in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Prepare-to hot-add a shelf]. 

* You must have installed the shelves, powered them on, and set the shelf IDs as described in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Install a shelf for a hot-add].


.About this task
* This procedure assumes that your HA pair has at least one existing NS224 shelf and that you are hot-adding up to three additional shelves.

* If your HA pair has only one existing NS224 shelf, this procedure assumes that the shelf is cabled across two RoCE-capable 100GbE I/O modules on each controller.

.Steps

. If the NS224 shelf you are hot-adding will be the second NS224 shelf in the HA pair, complete the following substeps.
+
Otherwise, go to the next step.
+
 .. Cable shelf NSM A port e0a to controller A slot 10 port a (e10a).
 .. Cable shelf NSM A port e0b to controller B slot 2 port b (e2b).
 .. Cable shelf NSM B port e0a to controller B slot 10 port a (e10a).
 .. Cable shelf NSM B port e0b to controller A slot 2 port b (e2b).
+
The following illustration shows the second shelf cabling (and the first shelf).

. If the NS224 shelf you are hot-adding will be the third NS224 shelf in the HA pair, complete the following substeps.
+
Otherwise, go to the next step.
+
.. Cable shelf NSM A port e0a to controller A slot 1 port a (e1a).
.. Cable shelf NSM A port e0b to controller B slot 11 port b (e11b).
.. Cable shelf NSM B port e0a to controller B slot 1 port a (e1a).
.. Cable shelf NSM B port e0b to controller A slot 11 port b (e11b).
+
The following illustration shows the third shelf cabling.

. If the NS224 shelf you are hot-adding will be the fourth NS224 shelf in the HA pair, complete the following substeps.
+
Otherwise, go to the next step.
+
.. Cable shelf NSM A port e0a to controller A slot 11 port a (e11a).
.. Cable shelf NSM A port e0b to controller B slot 1 port b (e1b).
.. Cable shelf NSM B port e0a to controller B slot 11 port a (e11a).
.. Cable shelf NSM B port e0b to controller A slot 1 port b (e1b).
+
The following illustration shows the fourth shelf cabling.

. Verify that the hot-added shelf is cabled correctly using https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[Active IQ Config Advisor^].
+
If any cabling errors are generated, follow the corrective actions provided.

. If you disabled automatic drive assignment as part of the preparation for this procedure, you need to manually assign drive ownership and then reenable automatic drive assignment, if needed.
+
Otherwise, you are done with this procedure.
