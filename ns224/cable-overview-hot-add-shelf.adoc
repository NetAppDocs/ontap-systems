You cable each NS224 shelf you are hot-adding so that each shelf has two connections to each controller in the HA pair.

This cabling section describes how to cable the NS224 shelf to the following storage systems:

* link:cable-aff-systems-hot-add-shelf.html[Cable to AFF systems]
* link:cable-asa-systems-hot-add-shelf.html[Cable to ASA systems]
* link:cable-eoa-systems-hot-add-shelf.html[Cable to EOA systems]

== About this task
* Familiarize yourself with proper cable connector orientation, and the location and labeling of ports on the NS224 NSM100 shelf modules.

** Cables are inserted with the connector pull-tab facing up.
+
When a cable is inserted correctly, it clicks into place.
+
After you connect both ends of the cable, the shelf and controller port LNK (green) LEDs illuminate. If a port LNK LED does not illuminate, reseat the cable.

** You can use the following illustration to help you physically identify the shelf NSM100 ports, e0a and e0b.

.NSM100 modules

* An NS224 shelf contains two NSM100 modules. The top module goes in slot A (NSM A) and the bottom module goes in slot B (NSM B).

* Each NSM100 module includes 2 x 100GbE QSFP28 ports: e0a and e0b.

.NSM100B modules

* An NS224 shelf contains two NSM100B modules. The top module goes in slot A (NSM A) and the bottom module goes in slot B (NSM B).

* Each NSM100B module includes 2 x 100GbE CX6/DX ports: e1a and e1b.

* After you have cabled a hot-added shelf, ONTAP recognizes the shelf:

 ** Drive ownership is assigned if automatic drive assignment is enabled.
 ** NSM shelf firmware and drive firmware should be updated automatically, if needed.

NOTE: Firmware updates can take up to 30 minutes.
