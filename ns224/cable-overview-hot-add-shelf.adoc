You cable each NS224 shelf you are hot-adding so that each shelf has two connections to each controller in the HA pair.

For most platforms, you can hot-add up to two NS224 shelves when additional storage to the internal shelf is needed. For the A1K platform, you can hot-add up to three additional NS224 shelves (for a total of four shelves).

This cabling section describes how to cable the NS224 shelf to the following systems:

* link:cable-fas-systems-hot-add-shelf.html[Cable to FAS systems]
* link:cable-eoa-systems-hot-add-shelf.html[Cable to EOA systems]

== What you ned to know
Familiarize yourself with proper cable connector orientation, and the location and labeling of ports on the NS224 NSM shelf modules.

* Cables are inserted with the connector pull-tab facing up.
+
When a cable is inserted correctly, it clicks into place.
+
After you connect both ends of the cable, the shelf and controller port LNK (green) LEDs illuminate. If a port LNK LED does not illuminate, reseat the cable.

* You can use the following illustration to help you physically identify the shelf NSM100 ports, e0a and e0b.
+
An NS224 shelf contains two NSM100 modules. The top module goes in slot A (NSM A) and the bottom module goes in slot B (NSM B).
+
Each NSM100 module includes 2 x 100GbE QSFP28 ports: e0a and e0b.
