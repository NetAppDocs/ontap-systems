You can replace a failed real-time clock (RTC) battery nondisruptively in an NS224 drive shelf that is powered on, and while I/O is in progress.

.Before you begin

* The shelf's partner NSM must be up and running, and be cabled correctly so that your shelf maintains connectivity when you remove the NSM with the failed FRU (target NSM).
+

* All other components in the system must be functioning properly.

.About this task

* Allow at least 70 seconds between removal and installation of the NVMe shelf module (NSM).
+
This allows enough time for ONTAP to process the NSM removal event.

* After you replace the RTC battery, reinstall the NSM, and the module boots, the real-time clock time is updated by ONTAP.
//05oct2022, Racer5/supercap: added bullet per Andris. No additional steps to set the clock since the ONTAP SES layer will sync its RTC with the shelf module/expander

* *Best practice:* The best practice is to have current versions of NVMe shelf module (NSM) firmware and drive firmware on your system before replacing FRU components.

+
[NOTE]
====
Do not revert firmware to a version that does not support your shelf and its components.


====
* If needed, you can turn on the shelf's location (blue) LEDs to aid in physically locating the affected shelf: `storage shelf location-led modify -shelf-name _shelf_name_ -led-status on`
+
If you do not know the `shelf_name` of the affected shelf, run the `storage shelf show` command.
+
A shelf has three location LEDs: one on the operator display panel and one on each NSM. Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. You can turn them off by entering the same command, but using the `off` option.

* When you unpack the replacement RTC battery, save all packing materials for use when you return the failed RTC battery.

.NSM100 modules

For NSM100 modules, you can use the following animation or the written steps to replace an RTC battery.

video::df7a12f4-8554-4448-a3df-aa86002f2de8[panopto, title="Replace an RTC battery in an NS224 shelf"]

.Steps

. Properly ground yourself.
. Disconnect the cabling from the NSM that contains the FRU that you are replacing:
 .. Disconnect the power cord from the power supply by opening the power cord retainer if it is an AC power supply, or unscrewing the two thumb screws if it is a DC power supply, and then unplug the power cord from the power supply.
+
Power supplies do not have a power switch.

 .. Disconnect the storage cabling from the NSM ports.
+
Make a note of the NSM ports that each cable is connected to. You reconnect the cables to the same ports when you reinsert the NSM, later in this procedure.
. Remove the NSM from the shelf:
 .. Loop your index fingers through the finger holes of the latching mechanisms on either side of the NSM.
+
NOTE: If you are removing the bottom NSM, and if the bottom rail is obstructing access to the latching mechanisms, place your index fingers through the finger holes from the inside (by crossing your arms).

 .. With your thumbs, press down and hold the orange tabs on top of the latching mechanisms.
+
The latching mechanisms raise, clearing the latching pins on the shelf.

 .. Gently pull until the NSM is about one third of the way out of the shelf, grasp the NSM sides with both hands to support its weight, and then place it on a flat stable surface.
+
When you begin pulling, the latching mechanism arms extend from the NSM and lock in their fully extended position.
. Loosen the NSM cover thumb screw and open the cover.
+
The FRU label on the NSM cover shows the location of the RTC battery, near the front of the NSM and to the right of the power supply.

. Physically identify the failed RTC battery.
//05Oct2022, Racer5: removed text describing location of onboard attention LED.

. Replace the RTC battery:
 .. Remove the battery by gently pushing it away from the holder until it is at an inclined angle (tilted away from the holder), and then lift it out of the holder.
 .. Insert the replacement battery into the holder at an inclined angle (tilted away from the holder), push it into an upright position, and then press it firmly into the connector until it is fully seated.
+
NOTE: The positive side of the battery, marked with a plus sign, is oriented outward (away from the holder), corresponding to the plus sign marked on the NSM board.

. Close the NSM cover, and then tighten the thumb screw.
. Make sure that the latching mechanism arms are locked in the fully extended position.
. Using both hands, gently slide the NSM into the shelf until the weight of the NSM is fully supported by the shelf.
. Push the NSM into the shelf until it stops (about half an inch from the back of the shelf).
+
You can place your thumbs on the orange tabs on the front of each finger loop (of the latching mechanism arms) to push in the NSM.

. Loop your index fingers through the finger holes of the latching mechanisms on either side of the NSM.
+
NOTE: If you are inserting the bottom NSM, and if the bottom rail is obstructing access to the latching mechanisms, place your index fingers through the finger holes from the inside (by crossing your arms).

. With your thumbs, press down and hold the orange tabs on top of the latching mechanisms.
. Gently push forward to get the latches over the stop.
. Release your thumbs from the tops of the latching mechanisms, and then continue pushing until the latching mechanisms snap into place.
+
The NSM should be fully inserted into the shelf and flush with the edges of the shelf.
. Reconnect the cabling to the NSM:
.. Reconnect the storage cabling to the same two NSM ports.
+
Cables are inserted with the connector pull-tab facing up. When a cable is inserted correctly, it clicks into place.

.. Reconnect the power cord to the power supply, and then secure the power cord with the power cord retainer if it is an AC power supply, or tighten the two thumb screws if it is a DC power supply, and then unplug the power cord from the power supply.
+
When functioning correctly, a power supply's bicolored LED illuminates green.
+
Additionally, both NSM port LNK (green) LEDs illuminate. If a LNK LED does not illuminate, reseat the cable.
. Verify that the attention (amber) LEDs on the NSM containing the failed RTC battery and the shelf operator display panel are no longer illuminated
+
The NSM attention LEDs turn off after the NSM reboots and no longer detects an RTC battery issue. This can take three to five minutes.

. Verify that the NSM is cabled correctly, by running Active IQ Config Advisor.
+
If any cabling errors are generated, follow the corrective actions provided.

.. Remove the replacement battery from the antistatic shipping bag.
.. Note the polarity of the RTC battery, and then insert it into the holder by tilting the battery at an angle and pushing down.

NOTE: You must ensure that the plus sign on the battery corresponds to the plus sign on the motherboard.
.. Visually inspect the battery to make sure that it is completely installed into the holder and that the polarity is correct.

. Close the NSM cover and turn the thumbscrew clockwise until tightened.
