You cable each NS224 shelf you are hot-adding so that each shelf has two connections to each controller in the HA pair.

.About this task

Some systems are compatible with both NS224 shelves with NSM100 modules and NS224 shelves with NSM100B modules. To ensure you cable your controllers to the correct ports, replace the "X" in each diagram with the correct port number for your module:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
a|Module type a|Port labeling

a|
NSM100
a|
"0"

ex. e0a

a|
NSM100B
a|
"1"

ex. e1a
