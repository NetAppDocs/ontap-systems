====

Learn how to cable a shelf to an AFF A320 HA pair.

.Before you begin

* You must have reviewed the link:requirements-hot-add-shelf.html[hot-add requirements and best practices]. 

* You must have completed the applicable procedures in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Prepare-to hot-add a shelf]. 

* You must have installed the shelves, powered them on, and set the shelf IDs as described in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Install a shelf for a hot-add].

.About this task

This procedure assumes that your AFF A320 HA pair has an existing NS224 shelf and that you are hot-adding a second shelf.

.Steps

. Cable the shelf to the controller modules.
 .. Cable NSM A port e0a to controller A port e0e.
 .. Cable NSM A port e0b to controller B port e0b.
 .. Cable NSM B port e0a to controller B port e0e.
 .. Cable NSM B port e0b to controller A port e0b.

The following illustration shows cabling for the hot-added shelf (shelf 2):

. Verify that the hot-added shelf is cabled correctly using https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[Active IQ Config Advisor^].
+
If any cabling errors are generated, follow the corrective actions provided.

. If you disabled automatic drive assignment as part of the preparation for this procedure, you need to manually assign drive ownership and then re enable automatic drive assignment, if needed.
+
Otherwise, you are done with this procedure.

.Cable shelf to AFF A700
[%collapsible]


====

How you cable an NS224 drive shelf to an AFF A700 HA pair depends on the number of shelves you are hot-adding and the number of RoCE-capable port sets (one or two) you are using on the controller modules.

.Before you begin

* You must have reviewed the link:requirements-hot-add-shelf.html[hot-add requirements and best practices]. 

* You must have completed the applicable procedures in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Prepare-to hot-add a shelf]. 

* You must have installed the shelves, powered them on, and set the shelf IDs as described in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Install a shelf for a hot-add].


.Steps

. If you are hot-adding one shelf using one set of RoCE-capable ports (one RoCE capable I/O module) on each controller module, and this is the only NS224 shelf in your HA pair, complete the following substeps.
+
Otherwise, go to the next step.
+
NOTE: This step assumes that you installed the RoCE-capable I/O module in slot 3, instead of slot 7, on each controller module.

 .. Cable shelf NSM A port e0a to controller A slot 3 port a.
 .. Cable shelf NSM A port e0b to controller B slot 3 port b.
 .. Cable shelf NSM B port e0a to controller B slot 3 port a.
 .. Cable shelf NSM B port e0b to controller A slot 3 port b.
+
The following illustration shows cabling for one hot-added shelf using one RoCE-capable I/O module in each controller module:
+

. If you are hot-adding one or two shelves using two sets of RoCE-capable ports (two RoCE-capable I/O modules) in each controller module, complete the applicable substeps.

NOTE: These substeps assume that you are beginning the cabling by cabling shelf port e0a to the RoCE-capable I/O module in slot 3, instead of slot 7.

 .. Cable NSM A port e0a to controller A slot 3 port a.
 .. Cable NSM A port e0b to controller B slot 7 port b.
 .. Cable NSM B port e0a to controller B slot 3 port a.
 .. Cable NSM B port e0b to controller A slot 7 port b.
 .. If you are hot-adding a second shelf, complete the "`Shelf 2`" substeps; otherwise, go to step 3.

NOTE: These substeps assume that you are beginning the cabling by cabling shelf port e0a to the RoCE-capable I/O module in slot 7, instead of slot 3 (which correlates with the cabling substeps for shelf 1).

 .. Cable NSM A port e0a to controller A slot 7 port a.
 .. Cable NSM A port e0b to controller B slot 3 port b.
 .. Cable NSM B port e0a to controller B slot 7 port a.
 .. Cable NSM B port e0b to controller A slot 3 port b.

.Cable shelf to FAS 500f
[%collapsible]


====

When additional storage is needed, you can hot-add an NS224 drive shelf to a FAS500f HA pair.

.Before you begin

* You must have reviewed the link:requirements-hot-add-shelf.html[hot-add requirements and best practices]. 

* You must have completed the applicable procedures in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Prepare-to hot-add a shelf]. 

* You must have installed the shelves, powered them on, and set the shelf IDs as described in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Install a shelf for a hot-add].

.About this task

When viewed from the rear of the platform chassis, the RoCE-capable card port on the left is port "a" (e1a) and the port on the right is port "b" (e1b).

.Steps

. Cable the shelf connections:
 .. Cable shelf NSM A port e0a to controller A slot 1 port a (e1a).
 .. Cable shelf NSM A port e0b to controller B slot 1 port b (e1b).
 .. Cable shelf NSM B port e0a to controller B slot 1 port a (e1a).
 .. Cable shelf NSM B port e0b to controller A slot 1 port b (e1b).
