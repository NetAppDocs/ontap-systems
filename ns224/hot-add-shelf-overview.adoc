Follow these workflow steps to hot-add your NS224 shelf.

.Before you begin
* This procedure applies to direct-attached storage only. To view instructions for switch-attached storage, view our link:cable-as-switch-attached.html[switch-attached cabling guide].
* To hot-add an NS224 shelf, your HA pair must meet certain requirements. Review the link:requirements-hot-add-shelf.html[hot-add requirements and best practices].

Depending on your platform model, you might need to install additional RoCE-capable PCIe cards or I/O modules, configure the non-dedicated RoCE-capable Ethernet ports for storage use, recable an existing shelf across two sets of ports in different slots for resiliency against slot failure, and disable automatic drive assignment if you are manually assigning drive ownership.

To install the shelf, install the rail kit for the shelf, and then install and secure your shelf in the telco rack or cabinet. Next, connect the power cords to power on the shelf and then assign a unique shelf ID to ensure the shelf is distinct within the HA pair.

Cable the shelf you are hot-adding so that it has two connections to each controller in the HA pair.

If you disabled automatic drive assignment as part of the preparation for the hot-add, you need to manually assign drive ownership and then reenable automatic drive assignment, if needed.
