You cable each NS224 shelf you are hot-adding so that each shelf has two connections to each controller in the HA pair.

How you cable an NS224 drive shelf in an AFF A700 HA pair depends on the number of shelves you are hot-adding and the number of RoCE-capable port sets (one or two) you are using on the controller modules.

.Before you begin

* You must have reviewed the link:requirements-hot-add-shelf.html[hot-add requirements and best practices]. 

* You must have completed the applicable procedures in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Prepare-to hot-add a shelf]. 

* You must have installed the shelves, powered them on, and set the shelf IDs as described in link:prepare-hot-add-shelf.html[Install a shelf for a hot-add].


.Steps

. If you are hot-adding one shelf using one set of RoCE-capable ports (one RoCE capable I/O module) on each controller module, and this is the only NS224 shelf in your HA pair, complete the following substeps.
+
Otherwise, go to the next step.
+
NOTE: This step assumes that you installed the RoCE-capable I/O module in slot 3, instead of slot 7, on each controller module.

 .. Cable shelf NSM A port e0a to controller A slot 3 port a.
 .. Cable shelf NSM A port e0b to controller B slot 3 port b.
 .. Cable shelf NSM B port e0a to controller B slot 3 port a.
 .. Cable shelf NSM B port e0b to controller A slot 3 port b.
+
The following illustration shows cabling for one hot-added shelf using one RoCE-capable I/O module in each controller module:

. If you are hot-adding one or two shelves using two sets of RoCE-capable ports (two RoCE-capable I/O modules) in each controller module, complete the applicable substeps.

NOTE: These substeps assume that you are beginning the cabling by cabling shelf port e0a to the RoCE-capable I/O module in slot 3, instead of slot 7.

 .. Cable NSM A port e0a to controller A slot 3 port a.
 .. Cable NSM A port e0b to controller B slot 7 port b.
 .. Cable NSM B port e0a to controller B slot 3 port a.
 .. Cable NSM B port e0b to controller A slot 7 port b.
 .. If you are hot-adding a second shelf, complete the "`Shelf 2`" substeps; otherwise, go to step 3.

NOTE: These substeps assume that you are beginning the cabling by cabling shelf port e0a to the RoCE-capable I/O module in slot 7, instead of slot 3 (which correlates with the cabling substeps for shelf 1).

 .. Cable NSM A port e0a to controller A slot 7 port a.
 .. Cable NSM A port e0b to controller B slot 3 port b.
 .. Cable NSM B port e0a to controller B slot 7 port a.
 .. Cable NSM B port e0b to controller A slot 3 port b.
 .. Go to step 3.

. Verify that the hot-added shelf is cabled correctly using https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[Active IQ Config Advisor^].
+
If any cabling errors are generated, follow the corrective actions provided.

. If you disabled automatic drive assignment as part of the preparation for this procedure, you need to manually assign drive ownership and then reenable automatic drive assignment, if needed.
+
Otherwise, you are done with this procedure.
