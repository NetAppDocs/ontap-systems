You can monitor the health of your drive shelf by understanding the location and status conditions of the LEDs on your drive shelf components.

* The location (blue) LEDs, on a shelf's operator display panel (ODP) and both NSM modules, can be activated to aid in physically locating the shelf that needs servicing: `storage shelf location-led modify -shelf-name _shelf_name_ -led-status on`
+
If you do not know the `_shelf_name_` of the affected shelf, run the `storage shelf show` command.
+
Location LEDs remain illuminated for 30 minutes. You can turn them off by entering the same command, but using the `off` option.

* An LED state can be:
** "On": The LED illumination is solid/steady
** "Off": The LED is not illuminated
** "Blink": The LED turns on and off at varying intervals depending on the FRU status
** "Any state": The LED can be "On", "Off", or "Blink"

== Operator display panel LEDs

The LEDs on the drive shelf front operator display panel (ODP) indicate whether your drive shelf is functioning normally or there are problems with the hardware.

The following illustration and table describes the three LEDs on the ODP:

== NSM module LEDs

The LEDs on an NSM module indicate whether the module is functioning normally, whether it is ready for I/O traffic, and whether there are any problems with the hardware.

The following illustration and tables describe NSM module LEDs associated with the function of a module and the function of each NVMe port on a module.

== Power supply LEDs

The LEDs on an AC or DC power supply (PSU) indicate whether the PSU is functioning normally or there are hardware problems.

The following illustration and tables describe the LED on a PSU. (The illustration is an AC PSU; however, the LED location is the same on the DC PSU):
